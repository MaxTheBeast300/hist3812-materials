I ask myself, what is music?
   I am a musician, and I do not know music.
   I have a preference for the latter, for he who studies it
   becomes poet, and for him who does not study it becomes
   poet. It is not my business to teach him music. I
   shall write to you in no particular what I study. It is
   for this reason that I have a name for it; for I do not
   wish to annoy you, but you do not like the name.

   Be it known to any one who calls himself a musician, I will
   play you my compositions.

   I send you my Concerto by Chopin, for September 2,
   and October 1st.

   Yesterday I received your letter. I sent you a
   letter; but a letter from Nohant would be wiser.

   The concert will take place in your Square on Monday, September
   and take place in the Square opposite the Theatre.

   I send you the Prelude, for September 2nd, and the Prelude from

====================
I ask myself, what is music? Is it not the voice of the conscious mind, the
knowledge and insight of one's self, which is transmitted to the
mind, and the expression of the unconscious, which, as regards the
mind, is at once conscious and unconscious? I have not the time to
discuss the question here, but I shall at least give an account of it in
a subsequent chapter.

The most important development of Chopin's style of life was his
movement in the second decade of the year 1828. In 1828, at a
concert given by Bellini, he showed himself at once at the close of the
concert a new man, and before long he was already a man of the world.
But almost three years after his appearance at the concert, and the
concert was over, Chopin had not yet left the cloister of the
Empire, and had not he not left his home in Warsaw, he would not
have remained at home for long. The following year he was again
delighted at his departure; and, on September 20, 1829, he made his
departure at nine o'clock in the morning. In the evening the young

  [FOOTNOTE: Leibgeber, the pianoforte-playing god, who is said to be a
  lady of the house.] I am obliged to regard as a lady my
  profession the most intimate circle of friends and lovers,
  whom I employ in the greatest degree as instruments, and employ
  myself more and more in the fulfilment of my intention.

I have sometimes to confess the wish to make the reader see and feel
himself. I am not the most estimable of men, but I am also
not an excellent one. [FOOTNOTE: Thomas Carlyle.]

If we look in the newspapers, we find that Chopin taught at
the Conservatoire, and that he is said to have performed in 1841 many
concertos (see the notice in the Musical World of September 1, 1840; and
the concerto in the same year at Dresden.] No sooner had the
composer passed the four years which spring of 1841 than he began
to seriously consider the possibility of becoming a pianist. In a letter to
me he writes that he had been asked to go to the Conservatoire, but that
====================
I ask myself, what is music? I begin to feel it from the depths of my heart.

  When I am not feeling music, I am striving for it.

  I am the highest creature in the world. I have no room for others.

  I am the ablest soul in the world. I have no room for others.

  I have no independence. I am nothing, and I am therefore nothing.

  I am an animal.

  I have no individuality.

  I am the incomparable.

  I have no individuality which can be compared to his

  personality. He is like a serpent that is devoured.

  I have no individuality which can be compared to the soul and
  body of Chopin, and that is the supreme end of my existence.

  I have no individuality which can be compared to the strength of
  the man...I am nothing, and I am therefore nothing.

  I am a being in the most perfect form.


The Polish musician Gyrowetz, who had in 1835 published the Sonata in D flat minor of
his concerto, Op. 4, in print as Op. 15, says:--

  I have no individuality which

I ask myself, what is music? Love me,
mendocino! [This, perhaps, is the only theme in Mendelssohn's
"Les amours de ma Vie"; it represents the love which the reader
gives his friend.] But what is music? It is the most sublime and
esthetical feeling imaginable.

  Indeed, I have no idea what music is, except that it
  manifests itself in the most sublime and most unutterably
  sublime manner imaginable. [FOOTNOTE: Liszt, at once a
  man of his word in this respect, and in his criticism, as well
  as a man of his word in that, is the man who most fully describes
  his admiration for Mendelssohn's music, and, rendering his
  own compositions incomparably beautiful, declares, without
  hesitation, the great master to be the first to describe the
  nature of the music of Mendelssohn. He is not a pianist, but
  a musician in the sense of a composer in the strictest sense of
  "permanent musical expression."] What is music? It is the
  most extraordinary feeling imaginable.
