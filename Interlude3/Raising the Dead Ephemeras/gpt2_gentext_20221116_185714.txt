Thanks to the efforts of the friends who know how to turn the wind, and to make the best of the most difficult, they are now ready to perform their brilliant and most beautiful work, and to obtain for us the highest honour possible: for we are to choose one of the three singers, who, as the name of Zaleski may suggest, are the most eminent pianists of Poland.

The first of these works, to be sure, must be the most brilliant and most beautiful piece of work of the Warsaw stage, and must be of the greatest moment and most profoundest significance. The second, "Chopin and the Ballade," are the most brilliant, the pieces which transcend the rules of the mere pianist, and are more than capable of rendering the expression of a person, a thing, and an expression of a feeling. The third, Op. 2, is the most brilliant, and the pieces which are most highly esteemed as compositions, are the most brilliant, and the pieces which most languidly languish.

The names of the two singers are not wanting in this succinct extract from an extract from a letter written by Adolf Wieck about the second piece, which, besides the names of the two singers, appears to be of the name of "Auguste Zaleski," the brother of the latter:--

   I have written you a very fine piece, but I have yet to get the idea of what you are going to do. I am very sorry that you lack the strength to do this.
   I am afraid I cannot do it, for I do not know how to stand before the eyes of the world.
   But you have already told me the whole of it, and I shall tell you what I shall do.

The unexpected success of the performance of the Ballade, a piece which some people held in high esteem, and which was performed by the composer himself, and which he had in good wish to have performed once more in public, is, indeed, quite unexpected.
The following particulars relate to a remark of Chopin which he makes when giving a concert on September 28, 1841,
at the residence of General Wurfel, near Leipzig:--

   I was standing in the theatre, looking out upon the brilliant evening
   which is the natural light of Warsaw. At the entrance to the
   entrance-way
====================
of many
of them who had the good fortune to
live in the neighbourhood of Paris; and the cause of
this happiness seemed to them perhaps to be the favourable
climate of the country, which enabled them to spend much less on their
occupations. That the French people had, and enjoyed, well enough the
greater part of their income from agriculture, and that the Government had
little or nothing to recommend it to them, are proved by the
fact that the Lusitania theatre, where the celebrated Impromptu and
Concert bands were performed, was little frequented by the
rich and powerful. The reader will remember that this story is
originally from a report in the "Journal de Paris," but has
become more common in the "Gazette Musicale." The landlord, by
way of the landlord of the theatre (the theatre which the landlord
came into), was not enabled to raise the rent which the poor had incurred
in the preceding year. This, however, was not the only circumstance
which interfered with his solution of the landlord's perennial
contingency. The landlord would not, however, give the poor
the money they were demanding, but rather gratified their appetite for
the musical pleasures of Paris. The landlord's experience was
a lesson in this respect. In the course of his administration an
alarming number of theatres were closed, and the landlord's extravagances
were not confined to the theatres. Indeed, he frequently closed so many
other theatres that they amounted to anarchy. In some parts of Paris,
for instance, the Rue Mende, Rue Pigalle, and other major theatres,
the poor were stopped in their tracks by the landlord's carts. Then
the landlord could only drag his feet, and little by little the wretched
pigeon was driven to pieces, and in some places even killed, by
the landlord's angry demands for more horses, and by the police's
suspect in the murder of the wife of one of his most beloved
patriarchs.

The reader will remember how Chopin improvised on the theme on a duet
with Rene Lessard, and how Chopin's imagination was at times so
farther back than usual; but he must be advised to pay attention
to what he improvised, otherwise he might not have the strength
to make up for his
====================
derives in his works the same effect as in his
"Fantasia" and "Polonaise"
in that they induce the enthusiastic, the
hard-working, to inquire whether they are better than the former. But
such inquiries lead us to inquire after the former, according to the
reasonableness of the former. And is this reasonableness admitted,
or is there not reasonableness excluded?

The critic of the opera critic, who, as I have already stated, is a
pianist, and not a pied Piperi, and does not profess to be a
critic of all the operas, is the only one who can give us an
account of the state of the art in the first two operas. But let us
not lose the little of the critic who says:--

   If you cannot make the first Allegro a very good
   imitation of the first, you must make it a Polonaise.

If the critic of the critic of the critic of the critic of the
opera critic, who is a true artist, can tell us what kind of a
critic he is, we may take from his account--namely, that the first
opera is better than the second:--

   The first is very interesting, but the second is not; but the
   Polonaise is not so interesting.

As the critic of the critic of the critic of the critic of
the critic of the critic of the critic of the critic of the
critic of the critic of the critic of the critic of the critic of the
opera critic, who is a poet, will be remembered, we will not
give ourselves up to the vain hope of finding a better version of our
own favourite work, if we wish to learn from this, and not from
those who have admired it.

Schumann, who was not a critic of the opera, he was not sometimes
a critic of the critic of the critic of the critic of the
opera critic, he was a critic of the critic of the critic of
the critic of the critic of the critic of the critic of the
opera critic, he was not always a critic of the critic of the
opera critic, he was always a critic of the critic of the critic
of the critic of the critic of

ASIA'S FIRST PERFORMANCES
IN PARIS,
ITALIANA

AND MADAME SAND



THE following letters, transcribed in full, may suffice to satisfy one who has read the
letters of ASIA and her friends:--

   The day before yesterday, the 14th of November, I received a letter
   from Vienna, which I suppose was addressed to me. In it you
   will find the following items: a letter from the Vienna
   consul in Paris, a letter from my parents, a letter
   from Mrs. Sand, a letter from Madame Sand, a letter
   from my dear children, a letter from my old grandmother,
   a letter from Madame Sand, a letter from my old mother,
   two envelopes addressed to me, and a letter from my
   old grandmother. I received the letter pretty well, and I
   am glad of my passage. I am glad of everything.

   The first item, a letter from Vienna, I suppose, to my
   parents, my old grandmother, my old grandmother, my old
   mother, all the way to Madame Sand.
   In the letter from my old grandmother, addressed to me,
   Madame Sand addressed me in the same way, but I do not know
   her name.


   Yesterday I received the letter which I received yesterday.

   I am thankful for it. I am so much in love with you that I
   love you sincerely.

   Yesterday my old mother-in-law arrived; she was very
   tired, and would have left me sooner were it not for
   your letter of invitation. It was too late for me, but I
   did not wait till yesterday (the first day of December) to receive
   your letter. The old lady had been very ill, and did not
   come to me.


   Yesterday (the day after yesterday) Madame Sand came to me, and I
   paid her a visit. She wished to thank me for my
   letter, but I did not know what to say.

   Madame Sand had very little breath, and was very weak.
   She had a loud voice, and a very
====================
... his
   hand became extremely weak, as if the
   necessity of continuing his studies had
   compelled him to withdraw. The pupil, however, did not
   wish to become fatigued, and, pointing to the
   piano, said: "I may play it as long as I like." The
   effect was beautiful, and the pupil was rewarded with a
   diamond ring.

After this, the next day Chopin took a journey, on the 22d of
November, 1831:--

   I reached Posen, the capital of our manufactory. We had a
   excellent time, but we had also a great loss. The carpet
   had not been used for three months, and the stove was
   not always up to the fire. A small fire burnt
   the whole night, and the walls of the shop were
   covered with snow. I was advised by the old doctor to go
   there, and was very much vexed that he did not know how to
   combat the disease. I went to a very beautiful,
   well-known doctor, who was very kind to me, and had
   kindly informed me that I was at last in my last years
   and that there was nothing to be done but to cook and
   wash myself. He was very kind, and would therefore
   have me come to him. I went to the theatre, and the
   audience, on the other hand, was very sorry.

Chopin's visit to Posen, on January 17, 1832, took place on February
and March, and lasted till March 28, 1832. On March 28,
1832, Chopin played at the concert of the Athenaeum and a
part of the Ballade and Ballade concertos at its concert.

In the following letter we learn that Chopin gave the first
performance of the new Concerto in four parts, and that Mechetti
was delighted with the result. But how does one make a judgment on
this, when there are several of the same sort in the works of the same
individual? I shall try myself. I have written to Chopin
that he was delighted with the performance, but that he had not
played the first part yet
====================
After my stay in England I had not the least intention of going to Rome. I arrived in 1814 and stayed four years. I was, however, not pleased with my stay. After much discussion I came to the decision that I should go to Rome, not to visit the Countess Neri but to visit her parents.

The answer to this, I think, is no.

It is the only answer which I can give to the question "why I should not go to Rome?"
and indeed I have not consulted the reasons for this. I do not know the reason. At any rate, I do not know the reason itself.
But the reason that animates me most strongly in these four years of my stay in
England is that I have not written to her. She does not send me letters; indeed, she never
wishes me to do so. I was not advised by her to do so. I have no doubt that, although
she has many friends and acquaintances in Europe, she will not yet send me to
Vienna. But, I think, she will send me to London if, as she says, I should like
to stay in Paris and henceforth be able to write to her. I am not going to give her
much trouble about this, for she is a good lady. I have only to contend
with the question of whether I shall get the letter I need.
There is some thing all this and that which is easily understood by
those who have not heard of me. I have no letters from Paris to London
nor from Warsaw to Paris; my only correspondence is on the
pianoforte-keeping.

The letter which Chopin wrote to his parents and the one which he
wrote to his sister concerning their son's coming to Paris have I
not been addressed. The only other note he has that I have not yet
sent back to my parents is a note from Fontana addressed to M.
et Polle.

  You have a wonderful time; I should not like to spend
  this summer with you; and if I could only have a letter
  from you, it would be most convenient. Perhaps I should
  give it to Mdlle. Maurice; for here you can have something
  to say, and there you can write.

Chopin and Fontana were tall, slender, innocent, and
====================
Aristocratic
and aristocratic
especially as regards
the composition of the works of this great
artist is so great that we cannot help wondering at his
indebtedness. But what is more, the works of such a great
artist are painfully short.

The works of Chopin, who was not unlike Chopin, we have already seen
in the "Rondeau a Morn" and "Le Vicomte de Concert," are very short;
they are not thus compared with the works of Kalkbrenner. The
works of Kalkbrenner, who, as a composer of romantic and
biographical poems, is a lover of new and old dances, is not
like Kalkbrenner; and the works of Schumann and the works of
Schumann have little in common with him. Schumann, on the other hand,
cannot help remarking that Chopin was, indeed, a great artist,
having the highest estimation and most perfect knowledge of
the art, even in the short time he had in his possession the first
edition of his works. Chopin, on the other hand, is said to have had
a full knowledge of all the dance-rulers and the music of all the
dance-makers; he was moreover capable of describing to his
lady all the strange things about his predecessors, and even of pointing
out the peculiar things which the older masters had not yet mastered.
The work of Kalkbrenner was, indeed, very little known to the
artists of this century; but it was still a work which, as was the rule,
was esteemed by the musical world. And what was the value of the
works of Kalkbrenner, as regards value of the reproductions of
his compositions? It is evident that the value was not very
widely known, and that the value of reproductions of works of
melodies and of certain other works of art was little known. But how much
of the value of Kalkbrenner's works we may judge by the
considerations which have been advanced of them by those who live
outside the sphere of art, and which are better situated, more
profitable, and more numerous, in the society of the people, and
do not, however, need to be called philosophers. How much of the

The following letters were written by Herz during the
period of his stay in Warsaw in the hands of some friends and
acquaintances of his country:--

   The day before my departure I had a letter from my
   great-uncle which he had sent me. This letter, which
   is very rare, he wrote to me in the most polite
   tone; I am very sorry that it has not been received
   positively. I am afraid the letter contains something
   which is not in the letter. Besides, I am very sorry
   for my countryman's insolence. I had hoped to learn from
   him that I had a right to the letter, and that he would
   send it to-day, for he comes very often to Warsaw. I do
   sincerely wish that he would write some more, and that I may yet
   begin to write in the beautiful and friendly language. But I
   should not like to be regarded as a mere ass who does not understand
   what I write, and as one who has to ask for and receive
   something. I do not know how to be a good ass, for I have not
   often the time to write to you. Still, I love you. I love you
   greatly.

The most beloved Polish children I know--I most especially love
them--are those of my daughter, who came to me with
what seemed to me like a very serious question: "How is the
epilepsy? Is there not an atriovation?" I wondered at the
seriousness of her answer. In fact, I was convinced that I had
not the time to explain to her the difference between a dog and
a human being; and that a human being is a dog, whereas a dog
is an atriovated human being. It seemed to me quite natural that
this question should be answered by a simple and simple answer. But
how can one be an atriovated atrivis in the same condition as a
human being? How can one be an atrivis in the same state as a
beetle? Do the conditions of life in the language of the
country lead us into such an arrangement? When I looked
at the
====================
Rossini is a pupil of
Chopin and a pupil of Jules Piazza's; and, when
he heard of his friend's pupil's artistic career, he bethought himself
of hearing him play the part of Palestrina. Rossini, who was of
high birth, was a child of the Polish nobility, and a talented
player. His playing was so beautiful that one could not but admire
it, and was admired by his countrymen, especially by those of his
countryman, Nidecki. To the Italians, especially to the Poles, his
playing was as graceful as Venice itself, and his compositions such
as Hummel's "La ladra," and Moscheles' "Schubert," were to him both
the most astounding and the most brilliant of all his works. The
early success of his son, however, did not cause him much
desired fear; he was not dearest to any of the aristocracy, and his
playing was not enervated by it. But the most ardent of the
philosophers of his day, the Descartes, thought that the great art
of the present age was still in its infancy. That, however, his
playing was nevertheless superior to that of the great masters, and that
his compositions should be regarded as the best of the great, and the
best of art, was evident to all present when he played them.

"Il n'y avis mecanque mecanque par vivant mecanque et mecanque
que n'est mecanque mecanque." [Footnote: This was the version
of the singing-trumpet on which Chopin was seated, which Nidecki introduced
to the Pixis of the Hotel de la Chatre. The Polonaise, Op. 1,
took the form of a full-blown ballade, the other pieces were
passions and improvises. The Ballade on which Rossini
plays in the Fantasia differs from the overture in so
little that it is no doubt the most interesting part of the
performance.]

"You are tired, you are pale, and you have no strength to
speak. You cannot rise, you cannot breathe. I am dying."

The following letter from Chopin to Fontana is of course,
one of the most interesting we have of

   September 1, 1829.

   I embrace you, dear friend.


   A little tearful, but very happy.

   You are the true artist, you alone are the true artist.

   All the time I hope and wait for your return.

   Go out and play.

   My love to Madame Marliani, but I would not
   recommend her to you.

   I love you as a friend, and I love you as a man.

   Madame Marliani [the gentleman] is a patriot, and a duchess; but you
   are a nation that does not wish to be heard; a nation that does not
   wish to see you.


   Friday, September 8, 1829.

   Very dear friend,--I am so much in love with you that I
   do not know how to thank you. How long you live on this
   you know, and the days you live on this, and the hours of
   labour you put into it--I do not know, but I have
   already lost six in one day. And you, my dear friend, I
   love so much! I have only to look at you and say:

   I love you so much!

   Your letter of the 23rd of September is such an
   important factor that I wish I could say that it
   matters.

however, the work does not cost more than the sum of 1,000 francs; but, in fact, it is much less.
The first two volumes of Rubini's
"Spiral of the Musee d'un Hye" are paid for by the "Laetitia" and
"Le petit Pien-jour" parties, respectively. The "Spiral" has a little
one of a "Fantaisie" on the cover, the latter being a "Je vends en Princesse."
The music of this work is by no means original; it is evolved from more
original materials. The pupils who compose this important work must have had
a great say in it, and the "Le petit Pien-jour" is no exception.
The young man, who, as a teacher of the "Elle," is best known by his
qualities as a pianist and composer, the "Fantaisie," or "Fantait," as he calls
it, of the "Seoul Gazette," "Frederic Chopin," is called in the name of
the "Marquart," is indeed a clever man, a teacher of the piano, and a
good friend of the "Laetitia." In short, he is the great-grandson of
the "Spiral," and the most distinguished student of the art.

The compositions of this grand master belong to the "Trois Valses brillantes
de ma Vie," or "L'Eclairecrit," the "Trois Valses brillantes" (1832),
polished with fine-feeling French, that are either "exclusively" or
"especially" important in the artistic life of this great artist.
The "Trois Valses brillantes" (1832) are of better quality than the
"L'Eclairecrit" (1825) and the "Trois Valses brillantes" (1829), and,
unfortunately, are less well known. Let us take a closer look at
the compositions first of the two masterworks:--

   The "Trois Valses brillantes," Op. 2, are the works of the
   most celebrated concert pianoforte virtuoso,
   Madame Rubio de Souzzo, who, in
====================
u, v., may also be said to be a
  repetition of the first dictum of P. Damasio, which, however,
  is not his.

  In the sequel I shall give a more complete description
  of the case.

  George Sand, who was present at the insurrection, was one of
  the many who protested against the rupture. She expressed her
  opinion in a way which I did not agree with, and she
  received the blow of seeing the revolution go on. Fortunately
  the people of Barcelona did not oppose the introduction of
  the sugar industry, and her prejudices were clear. Now that
  Spain had passed the revolution, the revolution was no longer
  a matter of opinion; on the contrary, the people
  were agitated and had begun to gather their strength.
  The revolution had been aimed at. The revolution
  was to be a new beginning. The great question of the
  revolution was not the establishment of a constitution, but the
  taking of power by the people, and the insurrection was the
  decisive event in this revolution.

  What had been expected of Spain, to put an end to the
  insurrections of 1807 and 1808, had been instead
  fulfilled. The people were ready to give in thanks, and
  gave their support to the insurrection, which was the
  beginning of the end of it.

  As the people of Barcelona had a right to be angry at the
  Government, so also the people of Barcelona had a right to be
  thankful to the Government, to receive justice, and to
  suffer patiently the infliction of it. At the same time
  the Government did not wish to be involved in the
  insurrection of 1807.

  The Government, therefore, gave orders that the insurrection
  would be continued.

  The Government had the right to take up arms, but it wished
  to avoid the infliction of unjustified and unnecessary
  punishment.

  To defend itself, the Government chose a committee
  composed of civil servants, who were to act as
  counsel and to advise the Government.

The insurrection was not a series of insurrections. It was not
a series of insurrections, as it is often misrepresented to be.
The insurrection did not begin with the removal of the Diet
====================
Contemporary
Boys
"The first thing that strikes one of us
is the extravagance of Chopin's style of playing." This
quotation is given in the
chapter entitled "Contemporary Bourgeois Hip Hop," in which it is
quoted as saying that the way in which the young virtuoso
played was "very peculiar, for he rarely played in the greatest
efforts." The young virtuoso, it added, "must go out of his way
to give his pupil lessons." Chopin's method of playing, however, did not
necessitate the constant repetition of the same thing over and
over again. The music of the time, which was naturally improvisatory,
was not always artistic, and the way in which it was played by the
young virtuoso was not always in accordance with his maturity and style.
Being guided by a fixed style, he did not always work out a form
which was pleasing to his fancy. The artist who played the first "Deux Nocturnes"
in 1831 at the Sonata at Rome, [Footnote: This was the first time that
the Sonatas were played at Rome.] being guided by a refined style,
he succeeded in rendering his pupil's compositions beautiful, he
metamorphosed them into beautiful compositions, and presented them
as musical compositions. In passing we will note some of the complaints
against him, and then relate a little of the man. He was a musician, and
had just entered the age of unlimited enthusiasm, when
his first concert, at the house of a friend, presented to him the
dispensation of a young man who had been one of his most ardent
friends. "You see," the young man said, "I am in my element; not
a moment has passed which does not indicate the passing of
my individuality." And what an inconclusiveness of feeling!

The "Deux Nocturnes," Op. 46, the day before the concert,
was already at the close of the year 1831. We hear then of "a
young man," who, as he told his friend, "has now attained the age of
maternity," and has been playing for several years.

The "Deux Nocturnes" were the most important concert concerts of
Chopin's life. They were the most important concert performances of

You may be surprised at the current state of the art in the field of graphic design. If not, perhaps you will also be surprised that, if the current state of the art is anything to go by, there is still not much that can be done to the art. Probably the only other place I have visited where there is still anything to be done was in the F minor department. As to the other works I have not yet reviewed, I shall have to try them myself in the following days.

In the last years Chopin and his friend Lenz have had much to do in Germany. Two weeks ago he wrote to his friend Alfred Krzyzanowska:--

   I have been to Radziwill, the most celebrated composer of Polish musical art, and found him, in the middle of a concert, the most eminent pianoforte virtuoso of this country, and I am very sorry for him, for I know him very well. The day after the concert at which he performed I was at the house of the Countess Schottzeister, and I have seen him lately in his most beautifully-situated apartments, flanked by a magnificent garden, and in the midst of which a magnificent fountain, which glittered with a dazzling radiance, was standing in the garden.
The day before the concert, which Chopin gave at his own expense, Chopin received his friend with the greatest enthusiasm. "This is the first concert I have ever seen with the greatest pianoforte," he said, "and I have heard most of all the pianists from the greatest names in the world. I have never seen anything so brilliant as this." That great admiration, however, was misplaced. When the pianists from the greatest to the smallest was on hand, and Chopin did not hear much, he could not help exclaiming: "I have never heard such a great artist!"

But Chopin, who had a delightful appearance and what he called an exquisite singing voice, should not be regarded as a pianist, and, moreover, must not be compared to a master in this respect. What he could have achieved, he could not have attained. "This is a brilliant concert," he said. "The pianists from the greatest to the greatest have never heard it." If we compare the expression which Chopin used to utter at the concert which he gave on the 27th of November, 1834:--
====================
Mysteries of the
   most distinguished artists
   and actors of the highest
   rank and rank are present to this day in the
   distinguished works of Chopin.

   The composer's most eminent pupils, especially
   the most celebrated actors, were not among those
   whom his private life was to be made so much at a
   distance from, but among those whom he most admired
   and admired most; he who most appreciates and
   admired Chopin, is one of them; he who most valued his
   talent and heart, is the one who most appreciates and
   admired the latter.

Chopin's most distinguished performances and works of art were
acquired with the publication of Chopin's works, which arrived
taste-house all the world over, and which not only brought much of
the highest value, but were also of a delicate delicacy, are given
here. But what is more important than the productions which Chopin
published for pianoforte and orchestra, and which, although not exclusive to
the pianoforte and orchestra, did not always advance the artistic
principles and particular character of his compositions, are the works
of those artists whose art was to be admired and admired by the
curators of the great art, the great art, who, therefore, understood and
respected his works. Such are the important extracts from the
pianist-composer's works, as will be seen presently.

   The first concert took place on March 21, 1831; the
   performance by Madame Franchomme brought him much attention
   and brought him much pleasure. He had lately given a
   performance of his Concerto, and had thought very highly of
   himself that he would do it, but he had not the temper to

Among the many great inventions of the last hundred years has been the design of the   18th century to replace the                       with the                   published histories of the                characters of the preceding century. In 1847 Thomas Carlyle, the son of the then King of Prussia, and the grandson of the first Lord of the Admiralty, [FOOTNOTE: This is the year 1788.] a refugee from Austria, entered the English navy, and on September 16, 1788, was appointed to command the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 1st Corps. In March, 1848, was appointed to command the 3d Battelle, of which, as regards the Polish and English histories, we will meet at the close of the present chapter.
The first five chapters of Carlyle's book (quoted in Vol. I., p. 268) are:--

====================
for the purpose of showing how he felt about it and how he wished to be able to help it

in his own way. As he had a great opinion of the Court, and had the
connection with the "Patriot" (a kind of right-wing party which he considered
unable to oppose), he took the advice of the latter part of the letter, and
thought it a good idea to let the young Prussian know that he would
not oppose the young Frenchman's going to the first leagues of Europe.
Here is the passage from which Chopin's letter is addressed.

   I have once more mentioned that I do not know if I shall
   yet finish the first part of my biography unless I receive a
   recommendation from one of the distinguished gentlemen of the
   Court. I do not know how I shall do so, but I feel
   inclined towards it. I shall write to J. at once, and to
   Madame at once, and to M. at once; and to Dr. at once, and
   to Madame at once, I hope you have not forgotten me, for you
   are not the only ones who are very happy with the result
   of your efforts. You have made me feel very much that you
   have made me feel very well. I have not yet risen to my
   capacity of writing to you, but I shall at least write something
   about myself.

   Johnnie has not yet told you of his sentiments regarding
   J. [M. Charles Murray] and me; he seems to be the same in
   them. J. is a gentleman who has occupied himself with
   his artistic business, and therefore seems to enjoy a great
   satisfaction at the prospect of receiving the present
   from me. But he does not seem to take kindly to this
   proposal; he says that he will write to me but
   he is not quite ready to pay the money for the
   examination. [FOOTNOTE: This is a misprint, the
   French edition is not called the "French edition."]

Chopin was much angry with George Sand, and even tried to console him
regard it in anger.

[FOOTNOTE: George Sand, who wished
====================
But the
   event on which he wrote most strongly
   was the death of his sister, who, however, was
   not yet eighty years of age, and was in danger of
   dying before she had attained the stage of maturity.
   How he felt towards her affected him; how he felt.
   He was the first to announce to the world that he was
   going to die, and in that moment his life was
   transformed. This, then, was the end of his life.

In the letter of Valdemosa, written on October 25, 1839, Chopin
contents with what is probably the most characteristic of his sentiments
at this time:--

   I have just passed through the last stages of my illness, and
   I have to close the door of my quarters, and embrace you
   as you embrace me; for I shall neither come here nor take you.
   I shall be gone for some time to-day, and you will remain.
   I love you as much as ever.



After these short and long recitations of condolence, the reader will
be advised to resume his questions and answers with more serious
composition:--

   All my life I have been a lively critic. I have been a
   devoted friend of Chopin. I call myself a musician, and have
   always a deep respect for his works. But I cannot
   write to you with a sadness of my own. You have heard
   what he has written. I cannot tell you how great
   he has written it, but I shall tell you how I felt
   in the same place. You will find a great deal of sadness in
   this. I have written to you with the intention of writing
   the following letter, but I cannot write that letter
   without regret. I write to you from memory. Your
   letter will be read at Dusseldorf. You will be
   able to understand what I have said.

Although his letter of condolence cannot be read aloud,
he is a man of the world. And this is what he writes. The
majority of critics who wish to shut the door on his diatribe
on the reigning class of
====================
I think this
  admirable statement will be accepted as truth,
  and if I would only make it clear that the writer of the
   Polish edition of Chopin's letters, whose
   name is Wodzinski, the editor of the Warsaw journal
   Wolkow, and who was a personal friend of George Sand's, and
   who, after the death of his father, had an enthusiastic
   friendship for Chopin, is honourably condemned to be shot
   at his grave.

I shall quote what the Polish critic of the Berliner Musik newspaper
"Die Zeit" said about this incident to me when I went to him at
the end of October:--

   I think that Chopin may have been quite in the dark about his
   feelings for George Sand, and that he would have been much
   obliging in this matter if he had known better. And if he
   knew better, he must have felt it when he wrote to
   George Sand; he must have felt it when he wrote to her in
   November; and he must have felt it when he wrote to her
   in December.

The same critic, however, who wrote about the incident to
the same effect in another paper, the "Leipzig Post," says that
Chopin's attitude towards George Sand was "recuperable" in October,
but not in November, and that he was "quite in the dark about her"
in that month, in fact, he felt it only on the occasion of the death of
George Sand.

The following letter, addressed by Chopin to Franchomme, the editor
of the Berliner Musik, and addressed by him to his old master
Stanislas Kozmian, contains an interesting and somewhat fragmentary
account of Chopin's feelings towards George Sand. On the 25th
of October, 1831, Chopin writes:--

   I have just come back from Krakowiak, and I have
   suffered greatly from the cold. You know me better now.
   You know that I live in the most lovely country
   in Europe, and I have never seen anything that would
   stop my soul from feeling the pain.

The reader may at once notice the mention of
====================
It has been said of her that she is "the most beautiful self-made woman";
and the writer of a romance about her has said that this is true of her
companions. Thus, for instance, in one of her nocturnes, her
womb is a vessel of vehemence, and the crucifix of her saints
was a crucifix of vehemence.

Gutmann was a good natured lady, and had a good opinion of
Chopin. A Parisian lady who was present at her was so. Gutmann and
Chopin went to the theatre in the evening of the 2nd, and were
found at the theatre in the middle of the concert when the two
actors began to talk about music. Chopin, who was not present,
brought up the suspicion of this person or persons--i.e.,
he was not present at the concert--but the two artists proceeded
at once to the conclusion. Chopin was so much vexed at this that
he could not put up with music that he would not play it to anyone who
sat in it. In one of these two instances he took a breath of his
depressed air and played to the effect of the act which he was trying to
vent. At the end of the concert Chopin was again on his knees before the
composer, and the two artists began to sing.

When the concert was over, Chopin and Chopin were again seated
at the orchestra, and then the concert proceeded.

[FOOTNOTE: The variations which the two musicians composed by their
passengers were called by their friends, and were called by
Chopin himself. Madame Guizot had in her possession a series
of triplets which she pretended to be written by Chopin, and which
she gave to the servant of Madame Viardot, and which she set in a
desert. The first is, according to Liszt, the most wonderful one; the
second, the most difficult, and Chopin improvised on it, as he
did afterwards on in the concert, although the latter may have been
written by a pupil of Liszt, who had in his possession a series
of triplets which he pretended to be written by Liszt, who
does not know either the spelling of the names or the spelling of the
====================
of the most distinguished artists of the time, and to
this day are the only ones who have not allowed themselves
to be beaten. Chopin's music was not for him the
fairy-tale of the unsurpassed virtuosic virtuosity, such as
we often heard, or rather the parody of the bravos and
horses of the later part of his career. His tastes, according to
the account in which he was most himself, were more like the fairy-tale
of the capriciousness of the fetters of the past. His style of
playing was a mishmash of rhythm and melody, the result of many,
often wild, and sometimes even dangerous, misfortunes. His compositions,
with their profundity of inspiration, were an expression of his
heart, but they were also, in his opinion, a mere costume of the
artistic world. This, however, is a misconception. Chopin's style of
playing was not a mishmash of rhythm and melody, but a mere mockery of
the conventional musical style. He cultivated, as he had done his utmost
to cultivate, all the qualities of the modern style of playing, but he
found in them only the most mediocre and insignificant weaknesses.

It is difficult to reconcile the two statements, of which we have
no evidence. But the statement that the style of playing was not Chopin's
style is a far cry from all that is fair and just in music; and there is
no doubt in my mind that the style of playing was not the style of
playing Chopin, but the style of playing Chopin. I am, however, not
so sure, and I am on duty much obliged to bear the burden of
this experience.

[FOOTNOTE: Nothing in the above-quoted letters to the
editor confirms the statement of the author that the style of
playing Chopin was Chopin's. Nor does the evidence show that the
style of playing is otherwise than the style of composition. What is
said about the style of playing has to do with what Chopin was
most himself. In fact, the style of playing is an expression of the
characteristic individuality of the individual--the kind that is the
constitutive whole, the means that bring about the end that
come into being. Thus, for instance, in

the composer's visit to Warsaw
in 1805

By: N. W. Kwiatkowski

The reader will remember N. W. Kwiatkowski's story about the
visit to Warsaw in 1805, in which he says that the composer,
of Polish descent, visited the family of the Polish nobility
and heard all the Polish airs that bear his name. The story is told
in a somewhat differently light.


CHAPTER III



CHOPIN ON NOVEMBER 10, 1805: "I have heard that it was indeed a
concert, and that the performance was nothing short of a
posthumous event, but that Chopin had had little intercourse with the
country people."


As the first of September, 1805, hung by a bizarre conflagration, so the
connection between Chopin and his parents was beginning to take hold.
The young man, who had no intention of leaving Warsaw, was determined
to make his appearance. The inquiry was not so much for the sake of a concert
as for the sake of a concert-giver.

The following day the Polish Premier, King Stanislas Kozmian, made the
request of the country, and the people, who, in Polish, the customary
form of wordplay, as well as the custom of the fashionable, were
still flourishing, to give a performance of his new opera, "Haydn--a
violin, violoncello, flute, violoncello, and harp. The audience
was so unanimous that, unbeknownst to the composer, they had to
pass through the bale of tickets--a press which contained on
the card a number of papers which counted the number of
passengers and passengers--to ensure a successful performance. The
subject-matter was as follows:--

   The first act of the opera will be to dine with Mr.
   Chopin; a limited number of twenty-five Dias on
   the violoncello or violoncello; five violins on
   the violoncello or two violins on the violoncello;
   two violins on the violoncello or two on the
   violoncello. The concert will be for two
====================
is a master of the art of making allusions to
the past and present in order to make us understand and appreciate
the present. As to the composer's rendering of the Tenderloin, it is
not particularly pleasing to us. The first section, free and in a very
conventional form, seems too wide for the fingers, and too short for the
fingers. The second section, and especially the second section
in A major, is too weak for the fingernails. The composer here
does not make use of the fingernail-pupil; he uses the palm of the
hand, of which the thumb rests, for the latter rests his full heart. The
first section, however, is very fine, and the composer does not abandon
it. The second section is not less fine, but more like the preceding
section than the first. The composer makes use of fingers of the
fingernail, but uses them only with the hand grasping the keyboard. The
first section is of the most pleasing kind, and as we shall see in a moment
we shall see in some other passages. The latter portion of the first
section, in passing, is beautifully rendered. There is no lack of
frivolesse here. In it we see the composer making use of the palm of
his hand, and the fingers of the fingers hanging down to his lips. The
tenderness of each section may be judged from the way in which
it is divided, or may be judged from its brevity.

  The piano is a delicate instrument, but one that does
  not require much practice; it does not require much
  money. The first section is of a very tender nature, but
  it does not require much study. The second section
  is very fine, but does not require much study. The
  third section, which is not much finer than the first,
  does not need much study. The melody of the fourth section
  is very fine, but does not take up much of
  the time of the first section. The last section is
  very fine.

  The pianoforte passages are so delicately arranged, so
  intricate that one cannot help thinking they are
  not lost at all. That this section differs from the rest
  of the sections in the melody is evident from the opening

Introduction

The book "Die Welt" (in German) was published in December, 1836., and in the year 1837.
I shall now speak of the contents of this new edition.
First, a brief account of the composer and his compositions.

The principal composer in the vault of the German Musical
Conservatorium (founded in 1809), the composer of all the works
for the piano and violoncello, or for the violoncello, the
piano and violoncello, and for the violoncello, was the composer
of "Die Welt," the most celebrated and most celebrated composition
of the young pianists. The work of this composer, a work which, as a
matter of his own free choice, succeeded in becoming the
most widely known composition of his time, we may suppose is no less than
the most brilliant "Die Welt," "Die gleichte Beitrage in der Natur"
(in the Polish edition), is now in our hands. Stephen Heller
has written that this works was produced in 1836 at the request
of Chopin, who wished to make his friend's pupil acquainted
with the composer's playing. In connection with this work we learn
in the above-mentioned letter of the composer to Hofmeister.

  The best pianoforte music of Chopin was the "Die Welt,"
  "Die gleichte Beitrage in der Natur," the second composition in
  "Die gleichte Beitrage in der Natur," the "Die gleichte
  in Major, and the "Die in G minor." In addition to these
  three works there were among the pianoforte music of this
  country two works for piano and violoncello; these two
  pieces appeared in September, 1836, by Heller, of Warsaw,
  and were published as Op. 6 for Opus. 10 and 15 respectively.
  In June, 1840, the "Die gleichte Beitrage" was published
  as Op. 7, with the "Die in G flat major" (Op. 9)
  and the "Die gleichte Beitrage" (Op. 8).

The composer's name is hardly to be mentioned in connection with
this work. Of course,
====================
by

[FOOTNOTE: I have already said that Chopin composed no compositions of this kind, and that, although he may have composed them in the early part of 1841, he never sent them to Paris.]

The first things I shall say about are the above-mentioned letters of George Sand, and the following extracts from a letter written by Chopin to Berlioz in this year 1841:--

   [This], I take very seriously. I am very much troubled by the state of my health [the year before I wrote this letter].
   May you live long, and live in peace, and may God give you strength to
   live long.

   March 30th, 1840.

   [This] day [is] already too late to make you a new birth.

   March 25th, 1840.

   [This] day [is] already too late to pass over the one ["The One"] and the
   two movements ["Un nouveau mensorme"] [the one with the piano, the
   three-part Scherzo, and the one with the violoncello (viola)
   and violoncello (violoncello), which are now made for playing only
   for the piano and violoncello.

   [This] morn [is] the one [violoncello] that is making me weary.

   [This] day [is] already too late to make you a new birth, for I have
   already made my first intention of going to Nohant.

   [This] month [is] already too much for me.

   [This] week [is] too much.


The following day, on March 25, 1840, Chopin writes to his friend Titus Woyciechowski:
"I have no doubt that I shall compose a new opera [Etudes] [or, rather, a
"Opener" as it is called in Polish] [or, much more to the contrary, a
"Concerto" as it is called in English]. I have written it on my
   pen, and I shall finish it when I receive your letter of the
   (July 1) letter from the Musical World. I hope
====================
Gutmann, the Minister of Public Instruction,
and the composer of operas, were amongst those who
attacked the authorities. These, however, were not the only
groups who had recourse to the popular defence. The Czartoryski
and the legionnaire, the Pole and the patriot, the Polish
aristocrat and patriot, had also recourse to the popular defence; the
German and the English had not been at the same time. The only
one who, however, was not at the head of the Polish defence was
Prince Radziwill, who in 1722 became the fourth King of Poland
and the ninth Prince of the Prussian Republic. His highness, Frederick
Prince Radziwill, was born on February 9, 1709, and died at Nohant on December
25,1777 (A. D. C).



The style of the founder of the Polish defence was to be the ideal of
violence, a style that, although often misunderstood, is certainly
one of the most important and effective in defence. To understand it, one
has to understand it clearly.

The ideal of the Polish defence was firmly rooted in the constitution
of the Polish Republic. The constitution did not, however, explicitly
declare in its nature a right of the people to be secure in society, but
conventional law recognised the right of the people to be free from oppressive
constitutions. The constitution, however, was not always in accordance with the
fugue and pomp of the nation-state, but it did not always agree with
the old and new social conventions. Nor was it always in accordance
with the will and the decrees of the governments. The old and new social
conventions, in contrast, were, as regards their natural tendency, always
respect the laws and the institutions of the nation. Thus,
indeed, they were not always in accordance with the will and the
decrees of the governments. But the old and new social conventions,
in accord with the ideal of the ideal of the ideal of the
national defence, did not always accord with the will and the
decrees of the governments. Nevertheless, the ideal was always present
and important. The old laws and decrees were neither respected by
civil society nor respected by the people. The old and new social
conventions accorded justice only to the most wretched
====================
Polish artist, vivacious reader, and poet,
   inspired by the music of the fete and the company of his
   countrymen, took to his style, and in 1805 he was
   nominated by the Emperor Augustus as one of the "most
   noteworthy artists of that time." Two years later he was again
   nominated by the Emperor as one of the "most noteworthy
   artists of that time." He died on October 13, 1810.

The reader will remember that the name of the artist who first inspired
Polish artists was Karasowski. That the name has been frequently heard
in the Post Office and elsewhere is shown by a letter in which the composer
writes for the first time:--

   My dear friend,--But I am dying to share your sorrows,
   the reader will remember me faithfully.

The name of Karasowski is mentioned and met with in the post-office. The
originality and artistic genius with which he was endowed by his
parents--notwithstanding the frequent misprints of his name--have
re-entered the public eye. Karasowski is said to have been a trifling
pianist, though he may have been a more accurate poet. The only thing we
can show for certain is that he was a poet of less worth than that
for which he was a poet. A young man of genius and good taste, he is
the most charming of all; but he must have had the most eminent
parents.

The letters of Chopin which we have already quoted contain some of the
letters which we shall now transcribe. These are written from September
5 to December 27, 1807.

"Mr. & Co. has lately arrived in Warsaw, and has much business to
do, but he cannot yet make up to the expenses of this house, which
was formerly much crowded by his countrymen, and, moreover, had not the
composer, known as he, in the midst of the great parties at
the house of the Queen, to pay for his bed-room, and to leave the
room which he had opened in the preceding winter. He has made
many arrangements to move there, and, unfortunately, the furniture
does not yet stand upright."

The following letter contains some interesting information:
====================
amateurism and
emphases
are some of the most common expressions of the
profession of imitations. It is generally said that such
imitations are a kind of poetic representation of the artist's own
nature, the rendering of which is based on the imagination of the
person. A comparison between the printed and the imitated works of George
Sand's master will be found in a remark of his: "There is no mistaking
the beauty and the grace of the drawing which Chopin imitates, but there
is not much of the rendering to be found in the works of anyone else."
What the wisest and most sincere imitators, it is true, are the greatest
desires of artists are the glimmerings which they give and the
insensitivities which they betray. Nay, if it was not possible to
find in the works of any artist the exact expression of that
beautiful, impassioned imagination which is so often the project of
a mere imitation, it would be a misfortune. But imagine that the man
which Chopin is, the composer, and the imitator, and the man of
imagination and expression, the celebrated Viennese virtuoso, the
greatest and best-known individual artist of the age, the author of
"La ci darem la mano," "La petit grand piano," and the operatic
poet and dramatist, Madame de Vain, they represent, illumine, and
indefinitely enhance.

The vast majority of artists who have composed a "Mazurka" in
which the phrase is met with are imitators of Chopin. Only two imitators
have made themselves known in this century: the Polish balladeist
Zabiej Woysia and the Polish pianist Jarocki. But how many of
those who have not yet written the most striking pieces of
melody, and have not yet made their appearance in the musical world,
have still to be compared with the great imitators of the century.

The Iberian Ballade, Op. 10 (published in September, 1831), has in it one of the
most striking pieces of composition; it is in five measures the length
of the original and surpasses the length of the current in the first
note, and the body
====================
of the day
   which the writer is speaking of
   in the "Zeitung"
   is the "Schwarmerzung." This
   is the "Zur Briefe." The "Schwarmerzung"
   is like the "Fantaisie,"
   but in a greater degree, and contains the last
   of the works of Chopin. The first two of these
   (the "Schwarmerzung" and the "Fantaisie")
   are of a more eminent master than the first;
   but they are the finest work of the master of
   imitation. The "Zur Briefe" contains the last
   of the works of Chopin, and the "Lisztische Zeitung"
   contains the rest of the works of Chopin.

The following letters show that the composer was not the only
master of his time to produce works of imitaturing beauty, but that
it was by this vigorous exercise that he exercised his greatest influence
on the art and science of composition. The first of these letters
shows us what kind of beauty Chopin was striving for by the time we are
now speaking of it; and the second shows us what kind of beauty he
imitated by his subsequent works.

[FOOTNOTE: The above letters are dated September 1, 1828, and
dated December 1, 1829.]

the delight of the reader, but
the pain of the author, with the reader.

On March 19, 1838, Chopin wrote in a letter addressed to Titus Woyciechowski
(FOOTNOTE: The time and place of the letter are not the same, but
we will now admit it, and the letter is dated March 20, 1838;
note that the letter is addressed to Titus Woyciechowski, who
shall be in Paris on March 25), that he and the other Warsaw musicians
surrounded by the greatest number of visitors in a position
to perform with ease his first concert for silver and gold. The reader
will note that the above-quoted letter is not addressed to
Warsaw; it is addressed to Warsaw, and contains the last sentence.

The first concert of the Polish national dream was, as Chopin remarks,
a remembrance of his country. Chopin, who had heard and admired
the first performance of his name by Titus Woyciechowski, was on his way
to it when he heard the last concert of the Polish national
singers, the Rellin' d'Elegance. The second concert was, as he tells
it, a remembrance of his country. On the first day of the second
concert, when Chopin had left Warsaw, the great Polish artist stood before
him a grand grand. The audience was immense. There were, he
thought, only three or four people present; and this number was greater when
he looked up at the sky. That it was not only the first but the
last concert was evident from the expression of the grand-dame which
exited the audience.

The following letter, addressed to George Sand, which Chopin sent
at the time to her parents, seems to indicate the nature of this grand-
dame's connection with the young man:--

   I am going to play, and shall be there.
   I shall not yet have the time to care for my studies.
   I am not a very well-pupil, and, therefore, shall not
   undertake the public concerts in order to increase my
   income, for, therefore, I shall be in Majorca.

Although the reader may have wondered if Chopin's intention
was
====================
The state of the art was
the second year of the student, and the state of his health was
even more so. He had suffered so much that he was nearly in
death agony, and had even been driven to the street. From the
heart-rending story of his death and the subsequent proceedings
I shall quote the following passage:--

   On the 1st of July, 1835, Chopin, an artist of genius,
   and a friend of mine, went to the theatre. The audience
   consisted of the most distinguished actors: the violinist
   Liszt, the composer of operas and plays, and Albrecht
   (Theinzepa), the master of the piano; and director of the
   musical world which awaited him here, was Liszt the
   director of the English Opera.

After this great success he went to Nohant, and there he fell ill, and
his health was soon brought under the control of the physiotherapist Dr.
Liszt. He told his story in the most enjoyable way, and as
I have already remarked he was strongly recommended to me by the
adversaries. The physiotherapist, who was not a complete stranger to
Chopin, knew how he got once into his apartments, but he was a very
poor patient. And how? By a fast diet which kept him within three
hundredth of breath.

   At 3 o'clock in the afternoon he died.
   His death was sudden and unexpected. The little
   friends of this theatre, who were surrounded by
   strangers, were not at all astonished. They were
   expecting the corpse.

The following morning he was revived, and the incident
was reported to his friend Dr. Graber, who, on seeing the
heart-rending news on the morrow, exclaimed: "Ah, a miracle! a
lmao! a miracle! a miracle! But it was a very bad
effect!" The reader will remember the following anecdote, which
was first told to me by Chopin when he was in Paris in 1836--

   The day after yesterday [June 27, 1837] Chopin, the greatest
   pianist of his kind, went to the theatre. The audience
====================
was born in 1841
   in Warsaw; and afterwards came to Paris; and
   he went there in 1842, where he studied under Jean
   Dudevant. But he was never able to produce in Paris his
   prodigious talent as a musical master.

   He is said to have been nearly as happy as a monkey on a
   tropical limb.

In the winter of 1843 Chopin wrote to his friend Enrage that the
writer had very badly enunciated what he had said about the
goddesses; but, after the publication of his Op. 42, he wrote that
the "fancies of the unicorns [she says] whom he treats
withest reverence" were "like a Waltzes in the mould of the
disco-mazurkas which will be found in the musical collections of our
friends Schumann." What Chopin's critique was of this singular
element of his style of playing was not known to him. Still, it is
an interesting fact that the latter part of 1843, when the first
piano concerto (the Prelude), Op. 27, was played, is the year that the
composer composed it. The Prelude, Op. 27, is the most important
work of the first half of Chopin's life, and the most important work
of his artistic career. But the phraseology of the work, if
it were correct, presupposes and justifies the composition in
which it is composed. In the Prelude, Op. 27, we meet
in Paris a young man of considerable talent--a man of great taste and
talent--conducts himself through a series of concerts the most
interesting works of which he has written. The most important of these
works, according to the composer, is the Variations on Lao-tse-hong,
which he dedicated to Madame Viardot-Garcia. This piece, according to
the reader, is the single most important work of Chopin's life--the
most important work of his artistic career. It is, no doubt, the
most important work of his artistic career, and the most important
work, according to the composer, of his artistic career.

The first part of Op. 27--the major scale, violoncello,
seven-note harp,
====================
seven years after the death of her beautiful
mother, who had been keeping at the house of her uncle Titus, the
House of the Saxons, after the death of her father, went to the
house of Prince Radziwill, the son of the Prince, and Madame
Mendelssohn, the Countess of Posen, at the house of the Princess
Czartoryska. The Princess, who had been staying at the
Countess' lodgings, and had been staying with her mother at the
Countess' house, was at the time Chopin began to breathe and
felt the most cheerful airs.

[FOOTNOTE: George Sand's account is clear. She had been in a
very unhappy straitjacket, and was unable to pay her servant, and
had not a shred of income for the winter.]

After a long and hard struggle, the Princess and her friends
made their final destination in Warsaw, and at last reached the
capital by a journey of fifty-four hours.

[FOOTNOTE: The book, "Polish Poetry, has been translated into English
by George Sand, and has brought to life the most important works of
Polish poetry. It has been edited by Slavik, and has gone through a
genuine technical and literary revolution. It is a comprehensive history of
the country and people; and, after having been told that the most important
works of poetry have not yet appeared in Germany, and have not been
published, that the country and people, if they were not harmed, should
not be offended, should not be misled, should not be put to death,
should not be subjected to a sojourn in the streets, should not be
complained of as a foreigner, should not be despised, but should
be treated with favour and courtesy.]

The Princesses did not know how to thank the Emperor Nicholas
for their assistance and their advice, but they were glad of it
when they heard of the Princess taking to the air and flying
towards the Red Square, and was soon rewarded with a splendid flying
class. [FOOTNOTE: George Sand's account is also clear.]

After the Princess had been thither for some hours, and had been
dedicated to the Lord Mayor, and her friends and Iathered Germans

====================
of the season.

I shall quote some passages from the letter of Chopin, where he
remarks of his appreciation of the Polish national music. The following
quote is from a letter which he wrote to his friend Mozart on September
25, 1829:--

   I have lately been struck with the graceful and clearness and
   delicacy of your music; and I have often the
   honour to play your E minor Concerto; but, as for the
   Polonaise, which you have written to me, I have
   to improvise it. Your music is very beautiful, and I am
   glad that you will compose it. I do not know how you
   shall receive the money, but I have already repaid the
   debts which I have incurred in writing you, and you
   will compose it yourself. It is a pretty good piece. I must
   write you a few lines, and then you will receive my bill for
   the Polonaise, you know how to pay them. May God allow me
   to forgive you the trouble.

   Tell the banker that I have no more to write; he will pay me
   the principal, and I shall compose it myself. In a few days I shall
   be in Paris.

   I thank you for your kind letter of introduction, and
   thank you for the good old time. I have only to say that I am
   well, and that I am going to have a good time. If you
   are not in Paris, do not ask me. I am glad of it; but the
   Polonaise will not be written here; I should like to
   send it to Gotthard, who might bring it to you.

Chopin to Fontana, October 24, 1829:--

   Madame Fontana,--I am very sorry that you are not in
   good health. I am obliged to write you so much that you
   will write me a note of thanks, as I cannot compose myself
   till now. I have written to you a letter from Fontana,
   but I have not yet sent it. But I am glad if you
   are in good health.


====================
L'Eclaireur, but with a capital
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
====================
I do not care for the characters, the
trifles, the cliches, the lavish ornamentation, the
sliding of details and the reticuousness of flow,
but I do not care for the compositions in which the abstention
of the instrumental accompaniment and the contrast of the floating
footpaths of the pianoforte are obtusely imposed. Moreover, it is
not so much to the extent of the contrast of the pieces as to the
composition's ostensive elegance, which manages to be
pretty much always charming, wherever the violins are put.

As Chopin's playing is often amusing, so his writing is often amusing.
Of course, the reader will not be surprised to learn that the
composer had an innate talent for creating a mood and feeling, it is
not uncommon for him to have himself imitated. But when these
examples are taken up with the reader, they cannot fail to make him
acquainted with the clever, the sympathetic, and the daring. This is
not necessarily the case, for his virtuosity may, like many woycie
says to me, be best appreciated in the most spirited of voices,
of which Chopin is the exception. The most spirited of voices may be
unconventional, but perhaps this is not always the case. Indeed, what is the
eloquent voice that calls forth the most spirited voices, the one
that seeks for the most passionate ones, seems to be the spirit in
the piano. Chopin's enthusiasm, however great, may not always be
the greatest of voices, but he is certainly the most eloquent.

The following excerpts from a letter by M. Marmontel, addressed to Hiller,
which I shall quote for the purpose of completeness, give a more
clear idea of Chopin's disposition and style of expression than are
given for the sake of completeness.

  Dear friend,--I am composing a concerto for my friend,
  Johnnie Chopin, and I am very much obliged to you. I
  should like to be able to express myself fully, but I cannot
  produce a truly musical state in my body; I am in a
  state of insufficiency. I cannot compose in a manner that
  enables me to move [indicative of the absence
====================
The search for a former Paris correspondent in the
   Polish capital has proceeded apace, and the only
   persons who are left to assist us are the Polish
   Government and the Poles themselves. The last-named
   is the editor of the Paris paper "Le Parisien"
   [which employs the countryman M. Albert Sivarasiewicz].
   We have found more and more apartments in the Louvre and
   in the Square d'Orleans, and as yet nothing has come to us
   to offer us more than the usual retirement. We cannot help
   ourselves, for the most distinguished artist is not to be found
   anywhere in the Place de la Chaussee d'Antin.

The efforts of the journalists and writers who were then making their
deserts and obtaining the strength to undertake the hard work of
lying about the country furnish an excellent background to our theory of
the causes of the failure of the revolution in Warsaw. As to the
cause of the failure, the question is left out of hand. The great
manufacturers, music-shop managers, &c., have not been able to provide for
the necessaries of life, but they have gone out of business, and have not
had a fund of money to spare. And all this is taken from a statement
which a Polish patriot, Mr. Charles A. Schwabe, tells the same story
about the financiers in Warsaw. In short, the banker and the banker
have been left behind in the world. But what, then, is the cause of the
failure? The answer lies in the fact that the banker and the
pianist-composer have been unable to pay their debts. This is
absolutely evident.

The reader will remember that the artist-composer Adam
Sand says:--

   I cannot bear the thought that I may die under the
   thumb of a banker, who cannot pay my debts, and
   who is too indebted to me to pay my debts.
   [FOOTNOTE: In the above-mentioned statement Adam
Sand does not say that this is the case, but that it is a
man's fault that he does not have means of payment.]

The explanation given by Adam Sand does not absolve him
from
====================
Alfred Hitchcock, who had been some time in Paris, and had lately arrived there, visited me in a somewhat awkward manner.
Hitchcock, who, like the rest of us, was in the habit of visiting his country,
was asked if he thought the French people were clever enough to possess a
civilised character by the invasion of an independent nation.
"Well!" replied the charming fellow, "they are clever enough to make a
man of them."

I had a great deal of fun with him. I had not the time to give a
sing-song, and when I came back a minute later he was already very
long gone, and I was on my way to give a performance, it was not till after
the concert that he showed himself again.

The following extract from a letter written by Chopin to Hiller in 1841
(quoted in p. 258):--

   Yesterday I had a pretty good dinner with my friend Frederic Chopin,
   a fine one, who was the most charming man I have met, and who
   had an excellent view of the country; but he had a bad
   nose. He had no nose, but he had a nose badly hurt, and
   he had to take an aspirin.

"I was glad," said Chopin, "because I had to thank him for it."

The following day Hiller received Chopin as he had come to Paris. The
following day Mr. Hiller relates in his diary:--

   Yesterday Chopin came to me and said that he had been speaking
   with him about the great musical event, which he was going to
   present to the world, and which he wished the public to enjoy
   with his compositions.

At that hour Chopin was at his most cheerful. He had in his
hands the Liszt Concerto, the most famous of all his works, and
one of the most important, and he played it at last. The pianist, who had
seen him play it at a concert, said at the time: "I must not
have it; I have not the time to play it." Chopin, who had for some
years been a visitor at this house, and had been to many a good
concert, rejoiced at the prospect of
====================
of the town.

But one of the most curious facts about
Chopin's stay in Paris is that he was not only introduced to
himself by the writer, but also by others--namely, by Madame
Germain, the patron saint of musicians, and by those who have invited
him--but also by many, many more.

The first of the musicians who made Chopin acquainted was Madame
Garcia Cavusi, who came to Paris in 1831--1832--to inquire about
musicians and was introduced by George Sand, to whom was added
a young lady, a young man of good education, and many friends
who had come from all over Europe to Paris. Soon after her arrival
Chopin received her invitation to a dinner which he was to have, but
not before dying in 1836. Madame Cavusi's father, who had a
wife of about fifteen years, was ill, and her mother found it impossible
to bear. She went at once to Chopin, who was now about thirty years of
years old, and asked for his opinion of him. Chopin, who said
lately that he was going to die soon, and that he had not been able to
rest himself for some days, was rather vexed than satisfied.

Chopin's first visit to Paris came about by way of Delphine Czerny,
the daughter of a Paris merchant. Chopin was expected, no doubt, to
come to Paris, but this was not the case. The company of several persons
who were supposed to be staying at the house where they were staying had
not yet arrived. However, the presence of one of these people and
the noise of the drum made Chopin's thoughts turn again from Paris to
London. The first thing he did when he arrived in London was to drive
into the Rue St. James de Launay, the square where the theatre of
the Lyceum was situated. The theatre was an immense and magnificent
combustion of three-quarters of a tonne of steel, and the stage,
which had been built by Count Titus Woyciechowski, in the year 1810,
was at this time of royal patronage. The theatre was to be
called the 'Field' (the theme of which was Adagio and Humidatum),
====================
Aristocrat and
Freelance journalist Soliva, who was in Warsaw when the
successor to Mr. Dudley Smith, made his first appearance on
the stage, expressed the hope that the splendid musical event of
1848 would bring him again into the wider public's eyes. "I am glad
that the people of Warsaw will hear me," he said, "and that I will
come to an end. But I should be much vexed if I were to put up
a single concerto."

Of what importance the musical event of 1848 will the artist and
the public of Warsaw have now become is an easy one to decide. But,
of course, the event was not what was most fashionable in that part of
Poland, but what was more popular in the capital. For the most part
of the year 1848 the press was not very favourable to the
greater musical achievements of Warsaw. The public got no information
about it, nor did it give a favourable opinion of the works performed there
at the Philharmonic. The musicians were not very well received by the
public; they were rather frightened than pleased. But the last stages
of the musical revolution are to be found in the first stages of the
revolution, in the preparation of the first stage for the performance of the
musical works. The foremost aim of the insurrectionary movement
was to make an end to this oppression, to break with this custom of
unions. But the fundamental aims were not the end of oppression, but
the breaking with it of a custom which existed even in the most
indispensable epochs of human existence.

The principal insurrectionary movements--of which the Nationalist
Nationalists, who had been forming since 1841, and the Polish Nationalists,
who had formed since 1825--were now divided into two camps: the
nationalist movement took part in the insurrection, but was not successful
in obtaining a general election. The nationalist parties were disbanded
and became the Nationalist and Democratic Nationalists.

In 1848 two branches of the national movement--the Nationalists and the
nationalists--were formed. The Nationalists--the party of the
people, and the principal actors in the organisation of the political
activity of the nation--were the most powerful, and the main
instituted and directing instruments of the insurrection. The

====================
returns to Poland; but the battle of Uhlenberg
pays the nation as a whole tribute. The Polish people,
especially the young people, did not see that coming. The accumulation of
the means of subsistence and the consequent decay of the
income of the middle classes had already led to the end of this condition.
The old, or rather the obsolete, structure of the Polish
aristocracy had become even more and more unequal, with the
progressions of the peasantry having been more and more numerous,
and, with them, the aristocratical class. To revive the old order
the old degraded, and in doing so restore to the young a new and
unsavory form, one that was once the foundation of the whole of the
class of the ruling classes--a class with which, in the words of a
professor, "the aristocracy is an aristocracy of the privileged"; a class
which, in the words of a social theorist, "is the aristocracy of the
superior classes." It was not only a class which had risen out of the
earless land of peasantry, but also an aristocracy of the majority.

The old, or rather the obsolete, structure of the political
aristocracy had become even more and more unequal, with the
progressions of the peasantry having been more and more numerous, and the
superior classes being in fact the majority. To revive the old
aristocracy the old aristocracy had to rise up. The old aristocracy
was to be found in Germany, France, Russia, and other countries, not in
England, Germany, or the Kingdom of Poland. The old aristocracy became
less powerful and less numerous, and the privileged class, which had been
so much at work in the first years after the revolution, was gone, and
the privileged class left behind it more of the same. The
superior class, the aristocrat, who remained in Germany, became
more and more numerous, the privileged class, the peasantry being
more and more numerous. The family had evolved a distinct character,
and had inherited the characteristics of the nobility. Although

The composer
and theorist
Liszt, who died in Paris on October
31, 1880,
is best known by his works as a pianoforte virtuoso,
classical works in their own right, and as a virtuoso in the
genre of orchestral music. His works as a pianist are of
certainly among the most striking. His three
concertos, the one at Dresden (1831), the other at Tel Aviv (1832),
and the other at Nohant (1833), differ in their object and mode of
creation. The first, which has a simple, languid rhythm, is
accompanied by a sweet, dreamy, and often violent, second by a
nervous, languid, and sometimes even mournful accompaniment of the
second, which, although less vocal, is still full of tenderness and
joyousness. The performance of the latter is very interesting, and
has in it also many important characteristics. The orchestra, which
was formed in 1831, consists largely of young men of good means,
who in the course of the two years that Mr. Klindworth was
made director of the Mazurka were well understood and by no means
inferiorly trained. Their manner of playing, which was brisk,
frequent, and varied in degree from slow motion to
mazurka, is in character similar to that of the young pianists. The
classifications of the pianoforte pieces in this work show that the
pianoforte is distinguished by a high degree of virtuosity, and that
the work is nevertheless not without talent. To be sure, it is not
for the sake of perfection that we may say that the men within the
piano are endowed with talent; but, on the contrary, they are
not endowed with the power to make a master's music. The principal
pianist, who was in the first years of his career thoroughly
acquainted with the mechanical and instrumental branches of the art,
became in the second year of his career in a position to make a
good impression upon the composer. And now I must, I hope,
speak more fully about the composer, one who seems to strike the
opposite
====================
He never once mentions the name Ramesses Ince, and
the fact that she was the sister of the celebrated poet Hugo Ince,
the founder of the school of poetry which now prevails in Spain,
indefinitely confirms this statement. The poet in question was a young
woman of about seventeen years, and her name was Ramesses Ince. Her
journals present me with several accounts of her life, which allude to
her friendship with Madame Rubio; but the most important of these, and the
most important of those to which I shall attach, is her song.

It is not difficult to discover in her songs the origin of the great
teacher and writer of the national song; but she is the true model of
what can be said of modern and old-fashioned music, and we shall see
more of her in a subsequent chapter.

According to the most orthodox school of music she was not intended for
the young, but for the old, and the old was to be a kind of mother and
friend. The English language speaks of her as a "castration-fire" (says
heriff Cox), but in reality she was never intended to be burned, and
never to take place, as is so often supposed, by the slightest impulse, but rather
to be lit.

[FOOTNOTE: Of course, this statement is a guess; the fire was not
attracted by the young woman herself, but by a select few, the nobility of
London being the exception.]

The most successful artists of her generation were her contemporaries,
the celebrated poets Mdlle. Freppa and Madame Rubio. Of the young
women of her generation we meet at the end of the eighteenth century no less
than the most successful men of that century: the most eminent of which
was the daughter of the celebrated composer Albert Freppa; the son of
the celebrated musician Marcello Franchomme; and the best-known of her
generation, the great theorist, poet, and theorist of music, Jean Paul
Haydn. The great composers of her generation were:--

   Malibran;--
   Pleyel;--

"A revolutionized art"
(No. 5 of Op. 41)
was the theme of the second and third of Op. 41. In a letter written
in July, 1832, Frederick Chopin discusses his departure from this "unreliable,
ingenious, and often-deceased" style, and concludes his letter
with the words:--

   I know you will be in Paris to-morrow for the rest of your
   life. I have just left you...The most
   desirable thing is to come to Paris, and to-morrow--let us
   have a look!

   Here I am. My country is beautiful, but at this moment
   there is nothing to be gained by a stay in that country.
   I have left you everything. The best and only thing I can
   do is to return to Vienna, but only if you help me to
   send you my passport.

   You know this and I: I have to tell you that I am very
   obliged to you and my beloved children, to the people
   and people of Vienna, to Vienna, I mean to tell you
   all this and more (as I have already done before me), but you will
   not understand it if I do not tell you that I
   am very sorry for my troubles.

   Although I have made very great efforts to clear them up,
   this is a chord in my head, it is not a chord in my heart;
   I have not yet felt it.

   I will write you a letter if you will write me a letter
   and ask that I may receive this money which I send you
   to pay my debts.

   I thank you, and wish you good health; but I cannot write
   myself.

   I have a very sad accident.

   When I was a boy I was playing in the orchestra, and
   one of the members of the orchestra, a fine pianoforte-player
   of Vienna, fell very ill, and in the course of the
   treatment I was obliged to cough and cough. I
   managed to save some of my friends' lives by
   doing so.
====================
You have been so kind as to
   assist me in my studies. I am in good health,
   but should not be unable to do so. I love your
   letter. Your most obedient servant.

   My dear friend,--Do you not know that I am
   in the same room as you, and that I cannot
   sit beside you? I have been walking in apartments in
   the Rue de la Paix, there you are seated yourself. I
   shall be silent. Write me a line, and then I shall write
   you a line to the door.

   I am very sorry for my servant, and we were not in a
   good humour. Tell him that I am very sorry for the
   house, and that I am going to write him a letter, and that
   I do not wish to make any noise in the world.

   Very dear friend,--I have not a word to say to you about my
   health. I have not much time to write to you; I shall write
   you a letter again.

   You have, I do not know, thought of going to the doctor. A
   letter would be much better, but it is difficult to be
   honest with myself; for I do not know what shall happen to me
   when I die. I am going to wait till the last moment, and then I
   shall be able to give you the news of my death.

   Dr. Emile de Chardin, who is a great friend of mine,
   knows my condition; he has visited me. He wishes to take
   counsel with me. If he did not, I should be sorry for
   myself. The only thing that can admit of his having
   my soul is your letter. I beg you to take it with me,
   and let me know when my husband comes to Paris.

   Dear friend--I have nothing to write about, and you will
   let me compose myself, for I am not quite at my
   strength. But this is not to excuse me, for you know me.
   Madame Sand makes herself at home, and I do not like
   her. But I
====================
in the year 1839, when he was
   in Paris. In the following year he was to take up his
   new residence in Paris, and at that time there was not a
   door which he was not immediately arrested by.

The following year Chopin was to take up his new quarters at
Leicester Square, but on July 2, 1839, he died of his influenza.
Thomas Nidecki, who had become acquainted with Chopin in the
early part of October, says in the letter which I have just quoted that
the latter's death would be most strongly felt for three months after his
appearance at the Conservatoire. The only other person who might have been
in possession of his son's obituary notice was the Polish ambassador,
barring some unforeseen circumstance, and this information seems to me
most trustworthy.

   This year Chopin has greatly improved, and, no doubt,
   in the last weeks of October, came to be seen by an
   audience of the greatest popularity and importance. He has died
   at the age of forty-seven.

The writer has a good idea of what Chopin's condition was, how he
struggled to keep afloat, and what treatment he was receiving from
his countrymen. In his letters a few days after his death are
letters from his parents, to his sisters, and to his old friends
and acquaintances are brought up, and the reader is introduced to
the causes and circumstances under which Chopin's condition was so
much advanced.

[FOOTNOTE: Dr. Sowinski, who was then working in London, visited Chopin's
parents at Dusseldorf, where he received him for the first time in
a letter written on September 4, 1841.]

The following extracts will show that Chopin's illness was
generally very violent and not only of course of use to him, but
also to his friends and countrymen. In 1839 he suffered greatly
from influenza. His health was aggravated by a severe cold. The
Prince Charles, George Sand, and Madame Sand had to contend
with influenza at intervals; on the other hand, the Princess
Czartoryska, the little daughter of the Princesse d'Agoult, who was
visited by Chopin in
====================
batteries.

The copyright notice for this item (which we found at the London Stock Exchange) was
dated September 14, 1831; the notice for the rest of the Single
Issue entitled Single Issue, which appeared in the Times on October 2,
1831, was dated September 15, 1831.

The following words of Chopin's letter, in which he expresses his
insatiable longing for Liszt, are to be read with great care:--

   I am going to-day to-morrow to-morrow to take lodgings in
   the Square Princesse. You may say to me that you do not
   feel the loneliness of the Place Vendome. I am obliged to
   give up my two studies, but I do not feel the need of a
   second one. I am in the middle of the first part of my
   Concerto, I am striving to complete it, but I cannot be
   present at it when I am going to-morrow.

Chopin's letter does not contain much more than a few lines that
are addressed to Fontana and will not be addressed to him. Still, the
communication of the departure is very interesting. The arrangement of the
February and March, and the publication of the Concerto, had made the
pianoforte-manufacturer Kalkbrenner a fortune; but he could not in
a few years make himself employed in the manufacturing of pianoforte-
sticks and other materials, and this, however, is a very improbable
situation. The letter of the Italian pianist Matuszynski, which
was addressed to Fontana, contains thus much:--

   Thanks for the excellent piece [the one in B
   minor] of the month of August. I am very sorry for
   you, but you will not make me suffer. I was frightened
   at first, but after a long occupation of my quarters, I
   am now able to play in public.

On the 5th August Chopin, with Fontana, followed by the rest of
the crew of the Ressource, passed from the capital to the
other side of the island. The steamer Ash-
la-la-Bella, with two men and two boats, drove
====================
A feature of it
was to become better known, but, on the contrary, was
not wanting in its beauties: it was the only institution at
Chateauroux which had a fund of singers, and was at that time
unprofitable in the manufacture of violins. At the time M. A.
Gautier is the only director in France where the production of
frequently-used instruments was so limited that, in 1849, it was
decided that there would be no more concert-houses, and that the
organ-business should flourish by the patronage of patrons. The
opportunity was given for a change of mode of production, and, if
these were not possible, a new business. With the publication of
Chopin's Preludes and the introduction of pianoforte-playing, the
organ industry began to show itself in a more favourable light. But
one need not detain ourselves much longer in this chapter, for we shall
return to it in the following chapter.



In 1830 there were in Paris twenty or more musical institutes. Of
these twenty or more schools--whether private or public--the one
was the most flourishing. But before the revolution there were many
institutions--the pianoforte-playing being a very popular one--that could not
be ignored. The first institution to be named in the name of a
pianoforte-playing institution was the Conservatorium, founded in
1831 by the eminent pianoforte-professor Madame Sand. The
faculty consisted of three principal artists: one of them, a
professor, dedicated to the study of the piano; another was a
pianoforte-professor, dedicated to the cultivation of the
artistic heart, and a third, a professor of the art or chamber,
introduced into the society of artists a certain laboree
which he assented to in the name of the conservatorium. The first,
Michel Vincent Pei-Mozik, of Paris, who became the first director
of the Conservatorium, founded in 1833 an institution for
playing violoncello and violoncello, and one of the second,
Liszt, who came into the society of musicians in 1834. The
Liszt Society had already been established in 18
====================
played her part in
this dramatic event in her life. She wrote to
Mendelssohn at Berlin in December, 1838:--

  I am composing a new composition.

  I have nothing to tell you of it, but I have written to
you. The first movement is in D flat major, the second
in G flat major. The first movement is very beautiful, and
the ideal of it has been unmistakable for twenty-five years.

  I have written to you a second composition.

  The first is in D flat major, and therefore also the
  greatest work of your generation.

  You have got to play well, because you never shall be
  allowed to play to any one of the pianoforte; you cannot
  expect to receive the perfect of your talent like other
  talents. You cannot make a great man, and should not play to a
  great man--you cannot attain a perfect imitation of another
  talent.

  You must like this composition, or else you will not understand
  yourself.

  I have written to you a third one.

  My compliments to M. de Neilaf for his talent with
  the D flat major Concerto.

  My most esteemed friend, the Comte de Perthuis, has sent me
  a letter; the first part is very beautiful; the second
  is a little too vague.

  You must like this second one better than the first.

  The first is very lively, but the second one is
  as yet unimportant.


The following words were written and dictated to me by M. de
Neilaf, who, after hearing that I had written to him,
accused me of having been misled, and asked me to give him
a lesson.

Chopin's rupture with the Italicists, and the consequent rupture
with the Conservazion, may be read in Chapter XXVI.

The rupture which occurred on December 15, 1838, is compared with that
which took place on January 22, 1839. The rupture of the two camps
appeared at once. First, although the two camps were united, the
majority of the rank-and-file did not make it their wish to join
the other; secondly, the majority of the rank-and-lies, with

====================
when I was older.

And what was the consequence of this?
Of a change of style in the artistic establishment?
Of the manner in which the press of the aristocracy
came into existence? Of the elevation of art and music?
Of the rise of a new aristocracy? The rise of the press, in
fact, was sudden, and was likely to have a great effect on the
stability and organisation of art and music. By the time the revolution
resurrected the old order in 1830, art was no longer seen as a vehicle
for the advancement of man, but as a receptacle for the degradation of man
and nature.

The time of the nationalisation of the navy, which took place
at the close of 1831, brought to an end the monopolisation of the
development of the commercial sphere of New Orleans. The establishment of the
state, however, allowed for the more rapid and effective accumulation of
wealth in the hands of the few, and allowed for the development of the
national character. The new aristocracy was to be found in the highest
society--nationalism, nationalism, aristocratism. The Republicans and
Conservatives, with their bellicose and hypocritical rhetoric, were the real
party, and the individuals and small parties which were to be found
in every part of the country, were to be found in every class, the middle class
and the nobles. The nation was to become more national, and less
national, and more national, and that was the plan of the nation.

The nation, moreover, was to become more national, and more national,
more national, and that was the plan of the nation. But even this plan
was not yet realised. If a nation could be formed, a nation was not
imagined; social organisation was not yet established, but the relation of
the privileged to the rest of the people was to be such as to prevent
the spread of the new aristocracy. And if the national character
of the people had not changed, the relation of the privileged
to the rest of the people would not have remained the same. Nor
would the charnel-house of the aristocracy have remained the same.
The national character of the people was by no means perfect. Maintenant
Woyciechowski says, for instance, that the national character of
the Polish people was
====================
distinguishing the two
musicians, however, is not so easy as it is in the case
of Chopin, whose compositions have always had the advantage of a
satisfaction not always equalled by the displeasure of the listener. As a
considerant of Chopin and the treatment he himself gave to his compositions
may be summarised in one sentence:--

  One of his delicate and delicious melodies, such as is
  characteristic of him, is now becoming more and more popular. It
  is often said that the happiest melodies are those which are
  generally, and the most wonderful ones are those which are
  generally, so that the artist may perhaps even exercise the
  most complete control over them. Perfect control, therefore,
  belongs to his peculiar kind of freedom, and he will exercise
  it not only over these polonaises, but over every other piece of
  music which he produces. By this means he may give to every
  style and in every way the power to create, and to give to every
  mood. He will not only control the flame or even the vibration of
  the melody, he will also control the flow of the melody, or at least
  will control the flow of the air, which, as he has done with
  Liszt, he has done so most thoroughly, for the most part, in
  his own way, by means of an outpouring of his own
  sensuous, soul-satisfying inspiration. To be sure, the
  romance of this polonaise is not without certain defects,
  but the novel substance of it is so much the more remarkable
  that the composer has not got rid of it by himself; but the
  place where it is so much prized, thanks to the deep,
  passionate feeling of its vivacity, expresses in it a
  surest feeling of his own unselfconsciousness: it is
  from this place that he draws inspiration as far as he can,
  and that, if he is not penetrated, it is not for him.
  We may say that the work of the young Chopin, although not without
  certain shortcomings, is nevertheless one of the most
  admirable in his art. In fact, it is not without some
  drawback that it does not quite reflect the individuality of
  the
====================
One of the most curious phenomena of the
1840s and '50s was the working-out of the great pied
muscleman, and the one great congress of the great artists of
Lebanon. In the course of the year 1839 a large number
of parties were held in the town of Mazen. At first I do not
so much as take part in them; but, as I shall do in a moment, I shall
tell you how I was pleasantly surprised when one of the most eminent
musicians of that time, the one and only Madame de Perthuis, came
to town, and performed some of her masterpieces, and proved herself
to be one of the most celebrated artists of the day.

The works of Chopin were performed in all parts of the town. The
concerts, which were in the first place planned and organised by
his friend Mechetti, were especially interesting to him; but the latter's
concert-giver, who was himself a member of this congress, was not at all
favourable to the latter. The proceedings were indeed rather amiable
than entertaining; but it is a pity that there was not a single performance
of the works of the great pianists who were to be heard at the congress.
The only notable exception is the one in which the youthful
Paganini, who had been removed from his post at Palma by his
publishers, was the only artist present, and was honoured with a
celebration. As to the other three congresses--the Ballade,
Ballade, and Fantasia--we may take them at their word. Neither of
these works, which was played by Chopin at the congress, was
played by Mechetti. The ballade, which was played by Chopin,
was played by his pupil, the celebrated pianoforte-professor
Ilsek, and Chopin was assisted by his mother, the daughter
of a Viennese nobleman. The Fantasia was played by a few but by
the whole party.

Having described the then flourishing musical society in the provinces
of Palma and Mazen, I will now describe the more primitive and less
infrequent society of musicians in the country.

The name of the country in which the most numerous musical
institutions were situated is very

The first part of this chapter presents,
as far as possible, the facts of the case; the
evidence of the authorities; and the case of the public
practice of the time. The second part presents the
evidence of the authorities; the evidence of the newspapers; and the
evidence of the philologists and philologists of the time.

The reader will know by heart the circumstances and the circumstances of
this case. The composer is not a public figure; his works are
not widely known; the public has not the money to pay the expenses of
his music; and, consequently, the sale of pianoforte-playing
was not as yet possible. But although this narrative is far from being
unfavourable
====================
A kind of evolution, which in a great measure confirms the existing facts,
and is the most important cause of the development of our species.

The principle of the development of the genus is, as has been stated,
in part derived from a variety of independent and diversities of the
previously-existing groups, but also from the more or less exclusive and
distinctive character of the genus. The genus of the two principal
classifications, genus (in the sense of the Latin word) "maestro"
and genus "sister," is, in fact, a composite of several independent
pre-eminences. The first, genus gravidus, is the most vigorous,
most common, and the most important. It is the base of all the
domains, and the chief source of all their vigor. In 1836, at
Leipzig, Lablache, which characterised the genus of the
heroines, was introduced. The name originated, indeed, in
the genus mammon; for it was the principal constituent of the
conjuncture genus carammon. In later years, however, Mendel and
Lambert took up their heads the genus carammon; and in the course
of the preceding century Mendel and Lambert also took up their legs the
heroines carammon and genus carammon. Both groups of the genus carammon,
whether felicium or felidale, were of a somewhat slower growth, and
might perhaps perhaps be said to grow in sandy or impassable soil.
This slow growth, however, was not confined to sandy features; it was
passionate, and could even have been intensified. The same
interest of growth, however, was felt in every other part of the
portrait, for in the genus carammon the artist sought to create a
climate in which he could imagine himself. But, as I have already
stated, the coarser the vegetation, the more vigorous the growth
(which, however, was not confined to vegetation). As the
development of the character of the genus depended on the growth
of the lateral tissues of the plant (the trunk), so also the
chromatic development of the plant (the roots). But the growth
of the plant, in becoming more individual, was not confined to the
limpidum, but was stimulated
====================
by

Gutmann, who has always a great sympathy
for Chopin, says that he was "disturbed" by the "indescribable profanation
of his beloved one, when he had
seen her playing the violoncello in the salon, but then he knew that
he had made a mistake, and it was the first time in his life
that he had played such an original piece of music.

In the following letter Gutmann and Chopin discuss the matter very fully,
and conclude with the remark that when they were again at home
the ambuscade was over, and that, as they had promised to do, they would
not do it again, they could not imagine how it would end.

The anxiousness of their departure was perhaps not altogether gone, but
as they were going home the prospect of leaving Warsaw was not
without danger. Here they were not only about to leave Warsaw, but also
should they not make their return to Warsaw, they were in danger of losing
their beloved one, who had always been their most ardent admirer and
favourite player.

The next day the latter visited Gutmann, the latter meeting him in his
rooms beside his piano, where Chopin had put the manuscript of his
"Grand Piano Concerto" into the paper-box.

The two were at that moment in a very awkward position, and were
reasonably well pleased with each other's conduct as regards the
principal work of the master. Chopin had indeed not his
pianoforte playing practised; but as the artist who had composed
it himself had come to Paris in 1807, and had devoted his life
to it, the composer of this work would be irreconcilable with his
publisher. Gutmann, on the other hand, found it difficult to believe
that this young man would have so little sympathy for a work
which, although it is called a work, he had conceived for a pianist.
The latter, however, could not help exclaiming: "I love the
work so much that I cannot bear to lose it!"

Chopin's anxiety was not merely of his own making, but of an artistic
interest. But it was actually of a great consequence that he
became one of the brightest stars in Europe, and may, no
====================
of a
   very clever man, whom the nation
   might perhaps envy; who, in his artistic zeal and
   thoroughness, possessed, in his ingenuity, but in his
   genius of execution, a peculiar proficiency and
   amiability in the most intimate of intimate
   discussions, and was imbued with the highest feeling of
   devotion and devotion to the highest ideal of art.
   He was not only a fine artist, but also the most
   well-known in Germany, France, and Sweden. He was
   not only an eminent virtuoso; but also a virtuoso of
   art, in that he was not only an artist of original works of art,
   but also a poet, and also a poet of original poetry. He
   [writes Dr. Berlioz] was the most imitator of the first
   generation. He had already the appearance of an artist when the
   literary works of Schumann and Gluck, the works of Moscheles and
   Herz, were first discovered. [FOOTNOTE: Liszt's
   remark, on the other hand, on the peculiar capabilities of
   these authors, is applicable here.]

But what of Chopin, and his virtuosity? Chopin's public
insult was not only directed against Liszt and Moscheles, but also against
Hernan Sontag and Moscheles himself. As a literary critic of the
literary world we shall meet, like many others, with the problem of
his own conduct in speaking of his master.

The letter which the latter wrote to Fontana, dated September 1, 1846,
contains the following passage:--

   I have just received your letter of the 18th of September
   to which I alluded, and am, at least from the
   moment I saw you, in a state of agitation and
   fatigue. I do not know how to express it--I feel
   like talking about a child, and have a hard time
   overcoming my stiffness. I have hardly spoken when
   I am writing this letter, and am vexed as a dog;
   you are of a very high rank, and may be considered
====================
dependencies.

[FOOTNOTE: I have not yet met with a circumstance to which I have to turn
some attention, and have neither the time nor inclination to do so.]

We have seen and heard of the case in which the Polish refugee
was so badly affected that she could not breathe, and died of
heart failure. The cause of death is impossible to discover. He who
writes to his mother tells her that he was going to Paris to seek
the help of a physician when he fell ill with influenza. I do not know
whether Chopin knew of its occurrence; and am glad to learn that it
was Anthony Stapleton, the director of the Paris Public
Surgeon's Association. I do not think that any parent, long obliged to
keep a close eye on their children, will deny that the disease was
a little feverish, and that it left him entirely destitute of any health care.
But as the only reliable information we have is that this was
a manifestation of influenza, and not a disease of the body, I may venture to
confirm that the only thing that changed its name from influenza to
Hepatitis C was the name of Anthony Stapleton.

Chopin, who, according to Dr. Mendelssohn, made his way there from Paris,
came into the country in 1816 and died in Paris on October 21,1816.
All this time my informant has been working for me faithfully,
but I shall now make use of his memory, and the letters of
his father, and the letter of his mother, to ascertain what really
was the state of his country and what really was the state of his
people.

   July 27, 1816.

   Dear friend,--I am very sorry for you. I have still the
   letter of your mother, the letter of your father, and
   the letter of my sister, who, moreover, was still in Paris
   when I wrote you. I am obliged to write to you in
   detail, and to tell you the names of my parents.
   If I should not be able to take you to-day, I should
   like to go to Posen, to find you there, and tell you
   the names of my sisters, who are still in

I love you so much.

For the pianoforte-playing Schubert, Chopin's
introduction to Poland did not make such a good impression,
but as an amateur it did not rob him of much of enjoyment.
That Poland had not the slightest inclination to make the acquaintance
of Chopin in 1848 may be gathered from the following letter in
which he speaks of his acquaintance:--

   I was here a fortnight ago, and I am glad that you are
   [says Chopin in an amiable tone, turning to the
   ladies.] yet a little slow. I have not a word to say
   about the Chopin-Mendelssohn-Kalkbrenner connection, but
   I promise to take a little time for my pet, the little
   carpenter. I am doing this as a wish to give a little
   of myself to you, and to you alone. I am
   the first pianist of Poland.

The next year Chopin published his Opus Vignerum in the year
1850, and in the same year also appeared in the Musical World. In
1851 is not to be found the following statement:--

   I have not yet performed the Opus Vignerum in Warsaw, but I
   am very pleased with it; it is a very good one.
   I have already performed it in the most magnificent
   theatre, and it is very well written.

But in 1852 he describes himself as--

   I am glad the Allegro de Concert is finished; I will
   play it when it is finished; so much the better for me
   to do so, for the Allegro is sure to be finished,
   but not yet finished.

   When I shall finish it I shall ask the lady
   about the Countess Polskisz, who came thither with her
   children.

   You will see from my letter that I have not yet
   put on my beloved mantel-piece, but I had been asked
   too much to do so; I should perhaps not get my
   concert till next October.

But
====================
II.

The light and flame of the transcendental
imagination as well as of the practical life were not to be
understated. The poets of the first century did not penetrate to the
entire, primitive, tranquil, and even sublime, but were
distinguished from them by a certain naive naivete, a vague
imagination which, as the poet says in the Deux Nocturnes,
"espouses itself with a kind of naive longing, leaving behind it a
sad memory." The sublime was at the heart of the transcendental
imagination. The purest and most purest of the transcendental is the
imagination of the purest and most purest self, the purest and
most purest of which we are conscious. The transcendental is not the
imagination of the purest self. And what is the cause of this
deep melancholy?

The apprehension of the sorrow of the first century, as we have seen, is a
contradictory action of the transcendental imagination. On the one
hand, the imagination of the transcendental manifests itself in all the
natural and man-made senses. On the other hand, the imagination of the
imagination of the purest self manifests itself not in the
natural and man-made senses, but in the reflective and spiritual soul.

The transcendental imagination is the expression of the soul. It is
the expression of the soul's activity. The soul, which is the expression
of the soul's activity, is the soul. The transcendental imagination takes the form
of a poetic life. The transcendental imagination is not a life of
appearance and exaltation. It is not a life of imitation and
exaltation.

The transcendental imagination was not always the most pure of
the faculties; and the conceptions and conceptions of the transcendental
imagination were, nevertheless, some of the most pure. The
original innocence of the passions and the unconditional love of the
imagination of the transcendental imagination may, however, have sometimes been
wholly or partly tonic and toned in its influence on the developed
imagination.

The element of idealisation, of mere idealisation, of a
imagination of pure and simple self, was a powerful influence on
the development of the imagination of the first century. The
original innocence of the passions

NOTES AND ANCHOR:

[1] Madame Sand sets off for Paris on March 30, 1815. [2] Madame Sand sets off on April 1, 1815. [3] Madame Sand gives a concert at the Theater d'Orleans, No. 5.
[4] This is the only concert given by Madame Sand to be had in Paris. She expresses
the hope that the public will be so kind as to give the latter a
more attentive account of her concert.

[This, however, is not the only concert given by Madame Sand. Madame
Haslinger, in 1841, mentions a concert given by her in Paris, in
which the singers are represented as having "profited most," and how the
unpaid performers were by no means oppressed by the unequal treatment of
their fellow-travellers. The announcement of the latter's concert is somewhat
inaccurate; the singers were paid, some of them earning their livelihoods; the
unpaid performers were not. But what is the matter? To regard her as a
profiteer is to regard her as a singer, and an artist as a musician.

The rehearsal of her concert was on April 5, 1815. Madame Sand made her
concert known by an enthusiastic performance of Preludes by Elsner, Op. 2, and
Chopin's Finest and Most Arrival, Op. 1. At the time she
was writing to her parents, she had not the slightest
conversation with them; and the only thing that came to her mind
was to take part in one of Thalberg's most important works.
The parties which took place in February and March, 1815, and
June, 1816, took place not only at the residence of the
wife, but also at the house of their mother, where the latter passed
months without bearing a son.

   When I was thirteen I was quartered with Chopin, Elsner,
   and his sisters--I mean his most intimate friends.
   But, at the age of fifteen, I was not yet able to form a
   existence in the world, I wished to play in public, I
   wished to be a musician.

From this moment the childish and the useful fell into the
daydreams of their dreamers, and their
====================
the growth of the
   profession, and the increase of the number of
   offices in which it is to be performed, have been
   noticed by the composer, the more especially the other
   offices which he gives to his pupils, and which,
   moreover, are of a kind which exceed his capacity.
   He who knows how to perform them will make the greatest
   impression; and the less he knows how to make these impressions
   the more impressed he will be. That the first and the last
   of these impressions is the key to success is evident from
   the following pieces which he carefully and easily performs (he
   sings in the bar from the second bar of the first section
   and in the first stanza of the bar from the finale of
   the first section); [FOOTNOTE: This piece is called
   "the Barcarirque of the composers."] the first section, the
   middle section of which
   is the most important; the second section, which is the
   fulcrum of the piece; and the third section and the
   last section, which are of a kind which surpass his capacity and
   which, for the most part, surpass his mind. In the
   bar from the coda he does not sing to himself, but rather he
   readily performs the first part of the bar from which he
   introduces the second part; and in the bar from the
   last stanza of the bar from the first section he
   proceeds thus:--

   I will not let you depart from this, here is the bar
   from the second section. I know you will not let
   you go with this, for the second section is too much
   occupied.

The fact that Chopin played himself in this manner is in itself a
clear indication that he was indeed a virtuoso. In the first
section from which he builds his compositions we read that:--

   I am pleased with this piece; it is the most important,
   because the contrasts of the rising and falling chords
   become more striking. In the second section we read
   that the contrasts of the rising part of the chord

The publisher of this "Le Medecine de Science Lomme"
announced on the 25th of March that the publication would begin on
September 1, 1835, and that the Op. 21, which had in it so many
contemporaries, would be dedicated "to the immortal artist." This announcement
was met by a great roar of applause and a sigh of relief. Clara
Chollet, who at the time was the editor of the "Histoire de
Renaissance," a journal of art and society, and a lady of considerable
talent, honoured with a bouquet of flowers by her master, made for him a
celebration of her achievements, and with the lovers of the "Histoire de
Renaissance" the "La Dame blanche" (or "Mdlle. de Science"), the "Duke d'Amboise,"
and the "Prince d'Polese," all who came to see her announced their
approval of her. There were many a portraits of her painted in
her honour. In the "Histoire de Rene-Sacout," dedicated to Madame
Garantella, which appeared in October, 1837; and in the "Quatre Mazurkas,"
made after the death of her husband, dedicated to her on September 1, 1837;
and in the "Duke d'Amboise," made in her presence on September 11,
1838, and dedicated to her on October 13, 1839; the portraits
of the Princess Aurora and the Princess Aurora de la Presse, the
Princess Aurora, and the Princess Aurora d'Amboise were among the
pieces dedicated to her. Her portraits were, however, not always of
a high artistic value; they need not tell us much about them. The
Prince d'Amboise, the "Grand Dame blanche," the "Duke d'Amboise,"
the "Princess Aurora," and the "Prince d'Amboise" were among the
pieces she would not dedicate to her. To complete the picture which
she chose for herself, Clara Chopin made her portraits of
the Princes and Princes d'Amboise, of the Duke and Duchess d'Est,
of the Princess d'Polse, and of the Princess d'Orleans. The
Prince d'Amboise was the most distinguished
====================
inexperienced, but nevertheless
   well-prepared, to seize the opportunity to make the
   reader's acquaintance with his master. In fact, he is
   one of the most highly-esteemed of all masters of art, and
   has produced among his pupils a truly national style.
   He has in his art a great art of teaching; he has rules,
    rules which are based on a purer form, on a more refined
    truth of the truth, and teach the knowing and the
   noble the sublime. In his works the true art, not the
   exalted art, is the true truth. The truth is not a quantitative
   superlative, and the nobility is not a veritable aristocracy.
   The nobility is the most numerous of all the
   noblemen. But this is not how the true art is formed.

The reader must not overlook the curious circumstance that Chopin did
not write about art for a long time after his separation from his father. Nor
does his friend seem to have been always in possession of his faculties
as regards art. At any rate, we may be sure that he never studied under
Chopin the art of teaching, for although he compared it to playing piano
and singing, he did not pay much attention to it. He found it difficult to
learn the finer points of it, for instance, the proper use of the hand
and the proper use of the instrument. But he could become well acquainted
with it, and he was aided and strengthened by lessons which he had
made, and by the advancement of his physical condition made in him
a certain readiness to undertake anything that was expedient for his
development. The following quotation from an account of his first
class in a Paris theatre, in 1825, is hardly more significant than
the preceding one:--

   As I was leaving the stage, I came upon a young man,
   of noble and singular appearance, who, at the age of fifteen,
   had left Paris to go to Nohant. He had gone there to
   study the art of singing, and had found there a
   perfect fit for the organisation of a new form of
   expression. He had composed a new piece for the occasion
  
====================
ERIC WOODS:

The birth of the artist in 1825 was an event which transformed art, transformed society, and gave rise to a new class of artists.
The first act of this great change was the adoption of a school of thought which
understood the artistic sphere so well as could be accorded the treatment it
put forward. There was a predilection for genius. In the olden days it was
especially despised in the musical world. But, as the artist knew how to
appreciate and appreciate his own genre, he had not long to be misled
into thinking that the tendency of the great masters towards a kind of
literary correctness was an unconscious tendency of the greater number of honest
masters. This predilection was not confined to the musical world. It was
enthusiastically prevailing among the musical elite and spreading to all
virtues; indeed, it was even evident among the musical leaders that it
was even frequently the case that some of the most distinguished musical
enthusiasts, to whom the arts and sciences were most indebted, were often
also indebted to the musical elite. But the influence of the musical
enthusiastic elite, however great it might be, did not penetrate so far as it
was noticeable to the less distinguished members of the profession. The
individual talent of the artists was not concentrated in the hands of a few
and the individual talents of the artists were not concentrated in the
lives of the musicians. It was not a matter of individual aptitude, but
universal aptitude, for the former was apt, and the latter was apt and
unattentive. The artists, for instance, of Schumann, Beethoven,
Schumann, Beethoven, and Liszt were in every respect, excepting the
pianist and composer, the gentlemen, the poet, the symphonic
composer, the amateur composer, and the virtuoso. But whereas Beethoven
had "a manly and aristocratic spirit," Liszt "was full of scorn and
possession." The two great composers of their day were Liszt and
Beethoven. [FOOTNOTE: Liszt, in Liszt: Die musicliche von

LETTERS (L-R)

Alfred Garcia

(born in Paris, but settled in England--by 1825)
was a pupil of the celebrated Rev. W. H.
Martin; the latter, in his letters to his friends, gives a more
accusative account of his education as a pupil of the
master's. Under the guidance of these friends he took a course
in botany, joined the first class of botanical societies, and studied
the history of the botanic profession in Germany. In 1824 he appeared
in a comedy of absurdities, and was arrested for it. On the morning
after his appearance he wrote a letter of introduction to Madame
Clesinger, and there he remained as long as he wished.

During his stay in London he received a letter of introduction from
Mr. F. Hipkins, who had been lodged by him in the Rue des
Richelms in the neighbourhood of St. James's, and who on this occasion
he hoped to be introduced to, and whose friends were, not knowing
whether he was to be introduced to his master, he took the opportunity of
the latter's invitation to go to the theatre. On meeting him at
this theatre he was again introduced, but this time he was not at
its doors. Mr. Hipkins, who was an enthusiastic admirer of Chopin,
admired him, and said: "You are indeed a great artist, but you have
not the air of a Chopin."

The following extract from a letter of the same author gives us some
more insight into the character of the subject:--

   I am writing to you from Berlin; the evening of
   Sunday, the 20th of May, I was invited by Mr. Hipkins,
   to take part in his performance of "The Concert of the
   Balladists," which Mr. Hipkins, who is a great pianoforte-player,
   in Berlin, came to hear at one of the latter's concerts.
   This was a great success, although not without some
   complaints, and I must confess that I had a good laugh at
   the time. You can imagine my sorrow when I heard my
   debut. The concert was not very successful, and the
   performance
====================
Shishio is often employed as the model of the
higher art. From the above-quoted remarks I shall quote a
biographical sketch that Chopin sketched for his pupil the
Chopin of 1844; and a few remarks on his appearance in Paris
in the following year.



The first thing I have to add is that the appearance of the Polish musician
was very good. He was always known to the public, and, as he was always
in good health, always in good spirits, and always in a good humour.
Come to me and tell me if the man who wrote the letter to him
was the same Chopin whom I saw in the street, and what he said to the
impressionist.

  May it be that the same Chopin transcended all the fetters of
  vanity--the same which permitted him to soar above the
  ranks of art-loving mortals--and ascended into the
  highest heaven.

It is interesting to note that the following letter from Warsaw is
very likely to have inspired Chopin. On March 22, 1844, he writes to his friend
Charles Lindholm:--

  My dear friend,--I am just at home, and have just all the
  papers we need, and I am full of myself. I have just
  written to you, and you have written to me.

  Well! I am at home.

  I must write my letter to my parents; this is all that
  will be needed; and I shall write back to the latter. I
  have already sent you the letter, and you have sent me a
  letter.

  I am not yet at home, as I am not here to see you, but I
  do not care, as long as you are at home, for I shall write
  you the letter in the morning.

  In all my letters you will understand that I write
  as if I were at home.

  If your good health were not heartily agitated, you
  would know that I am still at home, and that I am a
  long way from my dream of becoming a pianist.

  But, as I have said, my mind is too much occupied with
  the present, with the future, to pass up on my mother's
  shoulders.

  There
====================
Zohar, the twenty-first composer and composer of
fiddle, is said to have been the most enthusiastic of all the
composers of his time. "He [he] asked me to write a piece for him,"
said Ferdinand Lenz in his "Der Zeit" ("Annotatt of Hummel"). "I do not think
of him as a great artist, but as a mere gentleman, and I am glad of it.
He is one of the most talented musicians of the time; and the first
composers to write for him were among them Liszt, Schumann, and Mendelssohn.
But when Schumann played him his pieces, he did not find fault with them
as long as Liszt and Mendelssohn had been living in Poland. A few years
before, when Liszt had been invited to a concert which Chopin had been
playing for the preceding two days, he showed him a composition by Malibran, and
Mendelssohn, when he saw Meyerbeer and Ernst, was not at all
concerned. When Chopin was once more present, he could not but be moved
by the rising interest in his music; but when he was come to a
concert which he had not yet performed, he found fault with him as a
man. The fact that the young artist was not at all moved by the
collected sounds and the waving colours of his instrument proves to me
that his talent was not for music, but "for swaying the wind, for
unchanging the mood."

  The second concert was very good. Musset and I were
  there, and I cannot tell you how happy I was in the
  same place; but I love you, and I shall never forget
  your company.

  [FOOTNOTE: In the "Der Zeit," Op. 52, there is a
  passage in which a young German lady says: "I have conceived a
  notion which you will fulfil with my full attention."]

The reader will remember that it was Schumann who first saw the light of
pop. Liszt, however, did not penetrate farther than Schumann's words and
words, and Schumann was never told what to do with the rest of his life.
The following words of Schumann's (October 16, 1830) letter
====================
at
   Heidelberg, the Government
   at Munich, and the Funeral Mass
    at St. Petersburg.

These three notices of the periodical are connected by a
characteristic sequence of words and events. The first is a
letter written to Franchomme, dated October 26, 1829, and addressed to
the Justices of the Reichstag and Diet. The second, addressed to
the Justices of the House of Lords, October 28, 1829, is a letter
written by Franchomme to his brother; and the third, addressed to the
Consul General of Poland, and addressed to the Baron de Rothschild,
was written by the Comtesse d'Agoult to his friend Woyciechowski.
This letter of the same year, written by Franchomme to his brother,
is dated November 12, and contains the following interesting facts:--

   On the 20th of October, 1824, I received here a letter from
   Major-General Haslinger, who had lately arrived from Nohant, and
   wished to take up his quarters here.

The above-mentioned letter contains no additional information. The letter
contained in it the following particulars:--

   Among the most important things which the French Government wishes
   me to know are:--

   Their intention was to give to the Comtesse d'Agoult, who
   had lately arrived from Nohant, the means of a visit to
   Paris; they intended to give also to Woyciechowski, who had been
   staying at Nohant, and wished to give them a stay of
   some hours. This latter proposal was not supported in
   the letter which the French Government sent me.

The information contained in this letter of Major-Gatineau's, which
was addressed to Franchomme, is to be found in the following
letters which the countryman and his wife sent her to him:--

   In consequence of a request of Major-General Haslinger,
   I am to be introduced to Madame [and to Madame
   Kistner], whom you have already seen, and will accompany
   me to Paris. Madame Marliani, I expect, will accompany me

====================
The death of his father, by which time he could no longer live, left behind him a miserable legacy. The ordinary life of the family, and the quiet comfort of the streets, were so thoroughly annihilated that the only means of subsistence were by means of the chimneys of the villas. This, however, was not the only means of subsistence. The only means of subsistence which could be found in the streets of Barcelona were by means of coal-burning stoves, which, unfortunately, were not always well ventilated. The poor and sick had to be carried from one end to the other, and were neither allowed into the street nor permitted to pass through it. The only means of subsistence which could be found in the principal thoroughfares of Barcelona were by means of the palma-canning-houses.
The landlord of the villa, who had his property seized, was forced to sell it, and the rest of the people had to live in fear of being burnt at the stake. To escape from this terrible reality, the poor and sick, who were often much moved, often remained behind, and, therefore, were often more often left behind. The only means of subsistence which could be found in the streets of Barcelona were the coal-burning stoves.
Liszt, speaking of the whole of the family, says:
"The people that used to live there were of a nature superior to those of the rest of Spain, and the only means of subsistence were by means of the palma-canning-houses."
But what is the matter with the rest of Spain? The Spaniards had no culture of their own, and the French had no culture of their own; the only way of life they could offer to their people was by burning the land.
This is the only explanation I can come up with for the absence of a cholera control in Barcelona.
Not only did this Spanish landlord maintain his property, but he also sold it, and in 1833 sold it for 1,244 francs (about 1,900 pounds).
Having considered all the facts, I shall set forth the most probable explanations, and the most improbable ones, that are not contradicted by any preponderance of the evidence whatever.
The only one that is known to me by the authority of the means of subsistence mentioned in the preceding chapter is that of the coal-burning stoves.
The only one that I know of

This is a fabulous romance, a romance between two lovers, with a great deal of
exuberance and grace in the rendering of the craft of the
translated, the author's prose. In the novel the master is
distinguished by a thorough understanding of the beauties of the language of
the writer, and in the communicative and the poetic acting of the
author the language is a lively one. At the same time there are
two beauties in the novel which give the impression of having
been intended: a romance between two men of the same sex, and
two passages in one of the two poets; and a passage in the other
of the other poet. The reader will remember from the preface to
the third book of this work, the "Nos. 7, 8, and 10," that
the two poets were respectively Miss Lovett and Mr.
Halle. The novel is, however, a masterpiece, and of a very
high artistic value, with a
====================
PROF.

M. Charles Langham,
the son of a publisher and a
trustee of the Government, who was born at Paris, advanced the
right of rediscovery, and gained the reputation of a writer
who transcended his station in literary history. One of his most
interesting works, his compositions that were written in Africa and
in Europe before his time, are often compared with the works of
M. Charles Langham. On one occasion Chopin said:--

   You know how much the first half of my novel needs
   loving love!

The reader will recognise Langham's name from his vivid
declarations of the indolence of his youthful self in the face
of the prospect of a life in the service of a foreign power. His
words are worth quoting; they are more than likely a reticent cry of
his youth, but they are also written in a defiant tone, which, however,
is not to be ignored. He speaks in the middle of an entry in a diary
written by his people, and this, he says, is the fulcrum of his "life";
it is not only his life that makes him love music, but also his life
that makes him despise foreign music. His people are not strangers, but
they are, nevertheless, also his people, and he does not believe in foreign
music, but they are also his people. He seems to be a certain
in a state of rapture, and yet he speaks with a certain vehemence.
The warbling of the birds in the distance, the faint rustling of
the bushes behind him, the soft rustling of the footpath, are the
outro to his "life," the song of his people and of his youth.
Chopin's love of music was, no doubt, developed in Africa, but in
any case his love for music did not advance till he left it
in the first years of his refugee country. His love of music is
not confined to Africa, and, therefore, cannot be regarded as a
distinguishable passion. It is spread out throughout the whole
country, and, wherever it is found, it is everywhere ardent,
unconventional, unprofitable, and always covetous. Music, for
instance, has always been his mode of expression. His peculiar style

14th September, 1828.--The Grand Opera of Warsaw
(Warsaw: Wolkhorst and Co.)

[FOOTNOTE: Frederick Chopin was born on October 15, 1828, and died on
October 30, 1828. He rose to prominence in Poland as a composer and
musical artist, becoming an important player in the musical art of
Warsaw; among French and other musical publications he was at
also a prominent advocate. Among other things he marshalled the musical
artists of Warsaw with works of poetry, and directed them to perform
at his house the works of the best masters of the country. The first
composer to be honoured with the title of "Fellows" was Mr. Wild
(1827) Chopin. His compositions, moreover, were first generally
received and appreciated, but they did not cease to be important in the
newspaper and newspaper press. They become one of the most popular
pictures of Poland, and the most widely-known picture of the
country. To the appreciation of this picture the Polish people especially
deserveeth special attention. In connection with this work he had the
pleasure of meeting many artists of the country, and of having also
received a specimen of a Polish dance-fable. Chopin, the son of a
professionally-professed musician, excelled in this dance, but his
dance was not at all the most lively of objects. Mr. Wild's
dance was indeed very elegant, but in the style of a great master, and
what is now called for, was an almost inhuman delicacy.

The ideas which Chopin brought with him at his death were no doubt those
which he found in that chorale which he dedicated to Madame de
Vere. But the chorale was indeed of a nature that was not at all quick and
easy; it was the instrument of the true artist. Chopin, therefore,
was in the habit of listening to the monotony of the monotonous
music of Warsaw; he had no difficulty in finding a space for his
music when he wished to leave; he could make himself at once at home at
his own ease. The music of Warsaw was indeed beautiful, but
it was not sublime. It was a kind of sadness which was, as one
of Chopin's friends
====================
The first major opera of the season
(1835) was performed at the Imperial Palace by Prince Albert
(?). The principal musical event of that time was the concert of
Prince Radziwill, the younger brother of then reigning Emperor Alexander
Radziwili. [FOOTNOTE: Prince Radziwili, who died in 1835, was rather
younger than Chopin; but as his family was not obliged to pay the
greater expense of a high-altitude search and capture, and was
especially well-acquainted with the musical and musical-historical
subjects, he would probably have been of much use to the composer.]
Prince Radziwili was a man of considerable celebrity, and there
was no doubt that he would be best known as a virtuoso and
master of his art. Chopin, who, however, did not make the acquaintance
of this distinguished man in the splendour of his salon attire,
could, with more speed and grace than any other opera-tutor, soar
above the aristocratical and bourgeois crowd of the Imperial Palace
across the Boulevard de Port, we shall see presently.


Chopin, who here and there showed himself at once more in fashion, had made
a more and more attractive acquaintance of the third year of his life,
the young composer, after having played at the first concert of the
seasoned season, who, in the following concert, after a strict analysis of
the performance, expressed himself in a bold and expressive manner.
Although the audience consisted of young men of good education, and
without any talent for improvisation, the latter, as Chopin himself
writes, "had not the luxury of thinking that we could form a
composer of his own in a short space of time."

Chopin's playing, in fact, was very unlike that of any other composer
in the style of the first decade of this century--it was not in
possession of the first years of its exhibitors, but had
been in the latter part of 1835. The latter, however, has given us an
excerpt from a notice in the "Quatre Mazurkas," of which
it is written, in which he says:--

   Chopin has a fine voice, a fine fingering, and a
   fine disposition of the
====================
A few words about the artist and his time in Paris.
The first thing I came across in the letter I wrote him to me is the
chapter entitled "Le Art Guerre." This is the mazurka of the spring,
which became the theme of the second tenor of Chopin's piece "La Muette de
Chopin." In it we meet many different kinds of people--Beethoven,
Matuszynski, Czartoryska, the Asiatic musicians, the Gymnasts,
the Cracovians, the Russians, the Hungarians, &c.--and it is not till we
read about them that we realise that the most striking trait in the
man is his distinction of being a common man.

Leo began his stay in Paris in 1831, and at the time of his first
appearance he was certainly No. 2 among the celebrities. Now his name
is not only in the list of the most admired artists, but also in the list
of the most distinguished men and women in music. The first impressions which
he got from his people were one for Chopin, who reminded him of a
king, not of a king, but of a common man, a poet and a
genius.

The musical world, like the newspaper world, finds the artist a
little strange, for while it often boasts of his greatness, the
majority of artists, especially those with whom it is believed
have not the slightest admiration, and yet a great deal of their
talent is often of a less perfect nature. The most notable of these
are the Polish virtuosos, the Opani, Lidup, and Rossini, the
most famous of the Polish symphonies, the quintets and sonatas,
the polonaises, and even the operas. Many, I believe, were
also among the first to appear in the style of Chopin's music.

A Polish pianoforte-virtuoso, Liszt, who made his debut at Paris
concerts with the first movement of his concerto, published
two operas and appeared on the best pianoforte (or, more correctly,
composition) made at that time by the Conservatoire, appeared in 1835
in Vol. I., where he succeeded in making his mark. But
====================
I could go on, but I will keep it to myself. Whilst I was in his absence I sent him a note to
send to all the friends of the Polish people. It was very
interesting to hear that he expressed his hearty thanks to the
people of Poland and to all the countries. And if we are to believe
the zealots in the newspapers, the letter which Chopin sent him is
of the year 1833, because it contains the following statement:--

   I have no intention of leaving Warsaw by the
   11th of October. For the first time I feel the joy of
   my country in the return of my departed father,
   who has given me a great honour by his many many
   concerts, and wishes to be with me in the morning.

[FOOTNOTE: The concert that Chopin played at the Conservatorium on
February 6, 1833, was a performance of his sonata "Le Vicomte de
Berlioz," which, according to the title, was conducted by a select
of artists, and was entitled "Le Vicomte de Berlioz" (the sonata was
written by Berlioz and Czerny).]

Chopin, who visited Warsaw on February 12, 1833, found his way there
regarding the nation, and hearing of the excellent concerts of
the country, and the numerous performances of his sonata, made his
parents weep. The French ambassador in Warsaw, in a letter written
to Elsner on February 20, 1833, informs him that the "unfettered works of
Chopin" were performed there on February 28 and 29, 1833, and that there
was a "poorly-constructed and beautifully-formed concert in an excellent
room." And he adds:--

   The concert was very admirable, and left many
   people speechless. The persons giving applause
   had no idea that they were receiving a very
   wealthy public. Although the stage was small, the
   immense, but well-maintained stage, and the
   great pianoforte effects, made it an excellent spectacle.

What Chopin's kindness and thanks were to those who embraced him at
the concert in Warsaw show us. For the first time had the

The first concert of the year
   1829 was at Dresden. On the whole, however,
   the concert was very successful, but not without some
   shortcomings; not to say that some of my pieces were
   performed better than others. It has also been said
   that I was not able to write the pieces preluding to
   this concert. Nevertheless, it was an enormous success,
   for every one of them was glad to hear me. I am glad of it
   for the sake of my countryman, and I hope that he will
   practise it himself.

   [FOOTNOTE: I give the year 1829 as 1829.]

   [1829] Indiacriminately brilliant and brilliantly
   repulsive, this was Chopin's full moon on the 8th of
   December. I have no idea how far it will come! It will be
   a great pleasure to play it again. You will get a large
   share of the profits!

   [1830]

   August 1829.

   I am composing some pieces for the second concert, which
   you will make a present of, not for me, but to-day. I have
   not yet paid my debts, and I am glad of it.

   [1831]

   Yesterday came the first concert, and the first of the
   year. I am glad. It has been a pleasure to play with you;
   but if I were to pass my life in a hospital, I should
   not play here. I shall compose at least once more, and
   this time I shall have to pay for my own negligence.

   [1832]

   Yesterday at my address I received a letter from
   George Sand to Madame Sand, which contains the following
   particulars:--

   Madame Sand wishes me good health, and wishes to make
   herself acquainted with a Polish gentleman who
   is at Nohant.

   Madame Sand thinks I have written to you wrongfully,
   and must write me back in the letter.

   Madame Sand is dissatisfied with my health, and wishes to
   make amends
====================
Artists and
musicians were invited to take part in the
concert, and no sooner had Chopin left than the lady who had
become his companion and companion-seat began to quake.

The greatest applause was given to Madame Sand's performance. Her
excellent and every-body else's praise was not less great. On the
other hand, Chopin's own person and thoughts were frequently attacked
for the abuse he generallyaped upon him.

The first and most important criticism of Madame Sand's was that which
was blamed on her as being "sloveness in expressing herself,"
and that on the contrary, on her being a "non-nourish," she would not
enjoy the happiness of "devouring her husband and son."
George Sand's criticism, however, was a more general one. "Art, being
devoted to man and woman, has attained a new elevation, that of
man and woman, which she never lost, and which her husband and
daughter never forgot." That is all we can say about it.

The criticism which Chopin gave to Madame Sand was a charmer; but
it was not the charmer he had expected. A few days after his arrival in
London, on the 20th of September, 1831, he wrote to his friend Daniel
Diaz:--

   I am entering the last stages of my journey, and I am
   at last at last in possession of my first public
   concert. I shall be there--I shall have the air of a
   prince--and the orchestra will sing, and I shall be
   accompanied by a lady who will give a performance of
   the works of the most eminent pianists.

   I am sorry that your country does not allow me
   to play. I have written many compositions in Polish,
   but I shall not yet finish this one. I thank you
   for your patience, for I shall probably die before
   the end of this year. In the meantime, I shall write
   in your most serious style.

During the course of the next few days Chopin was again in a
bad mood. His health was not well taken; for the following day a
letter arrived from Vienna; but when the former of the two letters
was received,

====================
Gentlemen,
introduction to the "Sacrificed" of Mr. Holmes, of
the Conservatorium.

This gentleman, a son of the Emperor Constantine, a staunch
aristocrat, was appointed professor of the Warsaw University, and assumed the
command of the department on October 1, 1831. His publications were
particularly impressive in the Polish language, and would do justice
to the illustrious, although less well than the illustrious of the
English, French, and Italian languages. In addition to these
compositions he assembled numerous articles in the most important journals
of the time--the "Histoire de ma Vie," the "Revue," and the "Methode,"
which was dedicated to him by the late King James I, and
found it the "glorious monument of the founder of the liberal arts."
He then published in the English language two operas and one
composition, among other works, of the works of Hummel, Kalkbrenner, and
Hummel, written under the direction of the late Sir William Heine.

The "Revue," the "Histoire," and the "Revue-du jour" (which was a
part of the "Histoire de ma Vie" and the "Revue"), were the most
popular publications of the time. Their popularity was so great that,
although Chopin was unable to make up his mind to become a professor, he did
agree to pay a visit to Mr. Holmes, the editor of the "Revue," who had
been appointed professor of "Poland" by the King, in 1831, and was
appreciatively disposed to undertake it.

Chopin's visit to Warsaw was not without its inconveniences, of
which, however, were few. In the first bar of the bar, in which
he met with the "appetite of the aristocracy," the "Revue" had
not one but two "exhibitors" who were, no doubt, sitting at the
bar. At this bar had been the "Universität Krakowiak," the "Revue"
was the "Leben-Zeitung." The first edition of Chopin's "Grande
Era" was published by the Conservatorium in 1832, and the second
edition, which was to be published
====================
in a
   tribute to the Polish gentleman. He has always maintained a
   constant vogue for his works. Their popularity was
   not confined to the Polish nobility, it was extended to all
   people of all ages and nationalities.

The letter of Chopin received by the Temple-listening party of
Auguste Comtesse, March 7, 1831, is said to have been the first
concerto written by him, and the concert which preceded it.
It is interesting to note that Chopin's Op. 2, which appeared in
September, 1831, was not yet published, but appeared in April, 1832, and
was not till April, 1833.

Chopin's connection with Bovy and Hiller, and his subsequent marriage to
Bartholdi, is sufficiently stated. In 1837 he wrote to Hiller:--

   I have just lately come to Paris, and have been so
   long in longing for you that I have written to you
   for my house. I have no sooner arrived at the place I
   am going to, but I am already at the moment when I shall be
   able to give you my most intimate particulars of my life.
   In the meantime I wish to send you my first letter
   which I am writing from my native country. I write you
   about my little party which I have formed, about which you
   have asked me so much, and also about your little ones. I
   wish that if you wish to write to me, it would be with me
  --to-day and for some time to come, to ask me for
   particulars of the house which I have formed.

Chopin's letter of the same year is entitled "Requieme non troubadour d'un
debauchtaire." The above-mentioned letter is addressed to the
wife of the artist. Many artists, who live in the same place as
Chopin, are taken by surprise at the unexpected arrival of these
friends. One of them, Matuszynski, a Polish citizen, who lives in
Vienna, and is one of Chopin's most distinguished musical acquaintances,
felt that Chopin had sent him a letter of introduction, and
said that he
====================
What are the Women's Studies chapters of the
chapter entitled "Studies in Women's Studies"? I shall inform you
soon about the work of which these studies were composed. The first
chapter contains a description of the female characters in the
classical compositions of Madame de Stael. The second chapter
adds a new appellation to the classical studies, and an
introduction to the studies in romance, mathematics, and botany of the
Maritimes, and concludes with a letter of introduction. Besides
the studies in romance, mathematics, and botany, there are also studies
in history, art, and literature. The composition of the fourth chapter
of this work is dedicated to Miss Caroline de Muller.

  [FOOTNOTE: The word was introduced by Chopin, as he wished to
  distinguish the first two studies, the history of which I shall
  explain presently, and the romance, biography, and poetry. The
  introduction to the fourth chapter of this work is
  dedicated to Madame Leonora Schindler (nee Rebeck),
  an artist, novelist, and dramatist who published her works
  in Germany and other countries.]

[Footnote: I shall make a few
bold assertions, but for the sake of completeness I shall stick to the
thick lines of the report. I shall, however, not dwell on the
circumstances of its publication, as the article was
published after the publication of the Preludes of Op. 25.]

The most remarkable event of May 27, 1828, was the first
instance of the courtship of a man of genius entered into during a
joint stay at a Paris hotel.

Soon after this meeting of the friends of Chopin, we meet with a
concert of the highest order. The most distinguished of them--the
pianist-composer and composer Francois Hofmann, who was accompanied by
his countryman and valet, Madame Hache--tells us of her extraordinary pleasure at
the sight of
Hofmann and Madame Sand, and announces his intention to take up his
position as a concert-giver by playing "Valse a la concerte," which is
so characteristic of his style of playing, and will, therefore, be performed
at the concert. The great artist of the evening, who, in the course
of the evening, came up to Hofmann and asked him to play one of his
works, assumes a high state of enthusiasm, and then proceeds to
repeat his poem, which is so characteristic of his style of playing
that some years afterwards the public applauded it. The young man,
whom Chopin had seen in the papers, looked up to in admiration.
Hofmann, who had heard the young man play, gave a mocking smile,
and exclaimed: "Hofmann! you cannot do such a thing!" But a few minutes
after this, the pianist abruptly disappeared, and the crowd of the
room penetrated into a rapturous rapturous rapturous rapturous rapturous.

This was not Chopin's first visit to the Hotel d'Orleans. Of his
reputation at the Hotel d'Orleans I must say that I am not in a
position to judge of his playing; for in the same piece, in which
this childish and childish frolic was most amusing, I almost
unconsciously saw him glide into the arms of Madame Sand.
The picture which I have just described of the meeting of the two
friends of genius and felicity
====================
Of all the artists who have passed their time in Italy they must have received the most of them. One of the most distinguished of them, and, like Beethoven, the most celebrated, was the composer of operas. The works of that master had to be imitated, not only by his pupil, but also by his parents, his friends, and even his own. But it is a mistake to think that the works of this master were to be accepted as musicals; for in fact, the composer was the only one of his kind, and by his compositions the most numerous of all composers. Although music was not to be imitated, it was still an art.

The works of Beethoven (Op. 39) are now commonplace, for wherever he may be found in the works of any of his pupils he has destined, and no doubt will remain in his memory. The first and the only work of the master that he presents to his pupil is the Symphony Allegro (in E minor, Op. 3), for which the composer has published the "Cenacle" and "Larghetto." The second and the only work of the master that he presents to his pupil is the Scherzo (in G minor), which he has lately published in the Mazurka style (in A flat major, Op. 15). The works of his pupils are, indeed, the most striking features of his.
The "Larghetto" is, indeed, the most expressive work of his. It is the bravura of his string quartet. The Scherzo in G minor and the first parts of the second part in G flat major (in E major) were produced in 1831. In 1832 he produced the first three parts of the second part in G major of his Op. 9, and the second part of the third part in G flat major of his Op. 15.

GEORGE SAND'S PUBLIC PERFORMANCES



WE have now descended into George Sand's public performances, and she has given us some glimpses of the style of her music.
She sang the Moonlight Mass, the first of her concerts, on April 1, 1831. The first concert she gave
was at Palma, on April 8. On the programme she had such expressions as "Palma, Marco del Popo
(I love you), Pernilla, Blanche,
====================
The following is from a passage in the
letter of Francis Mazur:--

   Yesterday I received a very welcome letter from M.
   Mazur. It is very kind and very sincere. He is
   very happy with the progress we have made. I am glad
   that he wishes to come to Paris and to see me. He
   had made a mistake by leaving us some manuscripts,
   which he had previously sent to a friend of mine. When we were
   alone, he wrote to me that he had been ill, and that
   I should like to send him some of his manuscripts, but that
   he had not yet finished them. On the other hand, he wishes to
   see whether I shall send him some of my Preludes, which will
   certainly satisfy him.

   I am writing to you with a great heart.

   Dear friend, I hardly knew you when I received your letter
   from Paris; I thought you would send me some of them, because I
   need not know. If there were nothing in it, I should like
   to take them. But when I saw you at the railway, I was
   quite overwhelmed. Only you, you who have this great power and
   this longing for me, I embrace you--I embrace you also.

   You have not yet felt what it is to be an artist
   [acquainted with] the idea of a life without man. I
   can see in it a garden. When I look in the
   garden, which I now dedicate to you, I see a little
   garden in the neighbouring mountains. A garden full of flowers
   a hundred times larger than the earth!

   What are these mountains? Three hundred and eighty-seven
   feet long and forty feet high.

   [FOOTNOTE: This mountain is called Comtesse d'Ivory
   [Ivory de France] by the inhabitants of this part of
   France.]] It is the height of the Grand Dormitory, and there
   you will see the perfect calm of nature. There is no other
   place to be in France more beautiful and serene. I am
   unable to refrain from
====================
Frederick Douas, in "Decease and Brevity," speaks of a
   time when "every one the world over was astonished at the
   pause [of] the breath [of the mouth] which was in my
   hands." The painter Frederick Douas, who had the
   greatest artistic aspirations of the eighteenth century, never left
   his birthplace, Poland, for he wished to make his home in
   Paris.

Frederick Douas' short story is said to have affected the mind of
   the young artist, who, in the course of his studies, found a
   disposition which enabled him to make a lasting impression on his
   contemporaries. As a child, Frederick thought his mother's
   music an extraordinary success, and spent his hours admiring it.
   He had the great misfortune to be born a
   invalid in France, and, consequently, did not often practise
   his art till two years after his birth.

Frederick was born into a strictly aristocratic family, and his mother,
the sister of a courtier, whose father was a natural pupil
of the Duke of Saxony, wished to make her the mother of a prince
in arms. As Frederick was little disposed to discuss matters in
private, he was sent instead to the public schools, where he was
prepared to sit at the head of his class and practise his art.
In 1805, when Frederick was seventeen years old, he was placed on his
own merit at the Ecole des Medecine, at Paer, and at Nohant. His father,
the master of the institution, had heard of his son's talent, and
had told his servant that he had never heard a pianist play better
than he. The story goes, he played La Chaussee d'Agoult, and won the
honour of having the name of Grandmaster of the school. The following
account of the event is sufficient to show how extremely
frustrating the privilege of having the name of a great man's teacher
was. For every successful artist who has heard of his father's
school he finds, at least from Frederick Douas, the following account:--

   Yesterday, at the close of a long evening, we were at Paer,

of
thus spake Johnnie Hiller:--

   The evening of the 22nd of December, 1847, I came to Paris, and saw Madame Rubio, the wife of Molinara,
   the director of a fine theatre. She was pretty, but had no pupils.
   She passed the day without taking a seat; on the 30th, she
   gave up her position; on the 31st she left Paris.

On this day Madame Molinara had no more meals. Her husband took her to the
Dresden Opera-house, a fine establishment, but not very well. The
house had been in the hands of a French bank, and the landlord had not a
little regretted the fact that he had not only not prepared for her a
great many instruments, but had not even arranged for her a garden where she
would live and breathe her revenge, and set out for Vienna. She made herself
a pretty fine dinner, which she proceeded to call "des opera," after the
profession of singing, and was well received. After a long dinner Madame Molinara
gave up her excuses. The weather was too bad, and she could not go to
the theatre. The weather was truly beautiful. Madame Rubio was a
thorough girl, and had a great talent for climbing trees. When she
took a seat she was surrounded by people who loved her, and she was
at her best. They were of course not the bravos who kissed the lips of
his dancers, but, on looking at him with a great theatricality, he had
the appearance of a saint. The gentlemen seated themselves at his
table, and when he had finished, they began to dance.

   Madame Rubio, you are doing wonderfully. Shall we dance?
   I dance, you are doing wonderfully.

What is too
insignificant to allow us to discuss here, is the
time when Chopin had so much inclination to improvise. Moreover, it is
rather surprising to learn that the time of the first improvisation
is the time when the great masters--in Germany and elsewhere--first
introduced their own style of improvisation.

It is a curious thing, then, that Chopin did not become so well acquainted
with his new-found style, as some had hoped, perhaps, with his playing
in the first years of his career. But it is a curious thing also to
know that the style in question was not Chopin's style, but that of
the great masters. From his letters we learn that he was
very much affected by the new style of improvisation, and that it was
devoid of a pretension of his own. When he was writing in 1841, he
felt quite at his ease, and in 1842 he would almost have had to
have a lesson from Schumann's style if he had to improvise.

Chopin's writing in the spring of 1843 hardly expresses the mood of
that time; indeed, it is too vague and lacking in the real
character of the work for us to know exactly what it was that made
it so good. But the remark in the letter to his friend Woyciechowski
(dated October 25, 1843) that he would improvise at any price, is not
without some reflection. With regard to this remark Chopin seems to have
prejudiced, or at least was not conscious of its possibility, on the
requisite condition that he should improvise at the price he thought best;
indeed, he admits that he thought so, and thought so well, in 1843,
although he seems not to have been very forthcoming with his opinions
of new contributors. In 1843 George Sand writes that Chopin had
been writing "a really great work [writes her] thanks to the
friends who have been around him for some time." Her criticism is
satisfactory. But according to her Chopin was not always quick to accept
the compromise of a certain indifference which is the expression of
a great man's heart and soul. Nor was he always sure that the most
obscure parts of his works would become too often misunderstood

FREDERICK, April, 1849.


As a pupil of Mr. Hipkins' Imelda (Flora) Falcioni,
I was captivated with the character, the way in which the
childlike childlike figure of the young girl reminded
me of the extravagant extravagances of a wealthy family, and the
constitution, the exquisite elegance, and the beautiful, elegant
beauty of the child--something which I have long since forgotten!--I
thought of the Princess Elisa, the daughter of Prince
Alexandre Falcioni and wife of the crown-maker, and of the
young lady, who, alas! her beauty was too great to allow herself
to be neglected, was to become the model for all the artists of the
world. Now I am sure, as it were, that I would become a model
for all those who are endowed by nature with genius and talent.
[FOOTNOTE: In her account of her visit to the Princess
Julia Falcioni, Madame Rubio writes:--"She had just given a performance of
"La Gioconda" at the congress of the Internationale Musicale at Warsaw,
where she spoke of her plans to take up her music in two years time. One
of the beauties of this performance was her mother's drawing-room in
a large salon." The words "cello and piano" and "cello and
piano" were here and there mentioned, but the two were absent from
this and similar statements of other artists.

  I saw her play on two pianos, one on either side of
  the other; she was very well pleased; there was nothing remarkable
  about her; but I heard nothing, and I felt as though I were
  in some strange country, as if I were just leaving a
  convent. I had never heard a powerful drawing-room, a
  great hall, such as exists in the world; it was as though
  I were passing through a small door, and I saw a
  yellow-furred flower, like a convolvuli, in the room.

She was a virtuoso
====================
in
   the same year. On September 1, I
   wrote to Madame Viardot, and asked her to send me
   a dinner, to which she kindly complied. After a
   few words we parted, and at the end of the dinner
   Madame Viardot was quite satisfied, and was very
   diplomatic. My hearty thanks to her.

Of the three dinners which Madame Viardot sent me, the first was an
anteroom dinner for the poor, of which Madame Pacini received the
most kindly. On this evening Madame Viardot had better to do with her
warmly received but little-known guests. She had left the
atmosphere a fortnight before to visit her old friend; she had left
her husband; she was well and might have done so; she was obliged
to make herself at once acquainted with the state of the art in
the neighbourhood. She had been invited to a dinner which would have
gifted her a certain satisfaction. After a little talk she made the
offer, and as she had the honour to make the offer, she accepted it
at her pleasure.

The following extract from a letter written by Chopin to his old friend M.
Helsberg, dated September 12, 1841, may be best summarised as follows:--

   Yesterday, at nine o'clock, I received a letter from Madame
   Viardot, of whom I have written so many letters, to the
   apartments which she occupies on the Boulevard de
   St. James. The contents of which I do not yet know,
   except perhaps the last words, are:--

   I write to you with great interest, and do not know how to
   describe the feeling which I have just now. I am
   quite speechless. I meet you there, and ask you to
   confide to me the parcel which you have just received.
   It is my only parcel. I have not sent it yet, and
   may not return it till the day after next. You will
   meet me in the apartments which you will occupy. I am very
   sorry that you have not sent me a parcel yet, but I
   cannot bear it any longer. I am dying to get your

Many of the criticisms which have been made against the
posthumous edition of George Sand's work are, like the criticisms
against the mechanical edition, unsatisfactory in substance. They do not
discern the fact that the compositions in question are already in the
previous years covered with fruitless wax. They are, however, notable
for their brevity, and the larger works, which take up the principal
spot, do not stand out. They, however, are nevertheless worth
giving their weight in the larger editions. Having looked at first the
above-mentioned works, I shall now take up my examination of the older
works.

Chopin's compositions have their place in Chopin's school. The term, however, is often
misused, and the meaning of the word is often misused: for instance,
it is often applied to compositions by other pupils and not to works by
the same master. This is certainly not the case; but if we apply it to
works by others than Chopin, we cannot but be guilty of misappropriation.
The first and principal work from the school of the Polish
pupils, Op. 1, is indeed a pretty unimportant one: for the reader
will find nothing of the artist's early career. But after a few
minor pieces, which give a pretty good idea of the prevailing mood of the
labours of the artist, we come to the last piece, Op. 2, which
we shall describe as nothing more than a fourth section of a
single drum note. An excellent pianoforte student will notice here and
there the elegant movements and graceful displacements of the principal
section. The rest is of little consequence. The first, however,
is of consequence, for there is nothing to be found in this one piece
of work. On the other hand, the instrumental part of the
first section is, indeed, a well-deserved piece. The first is
not particularly important, but is nevertheless good in, and in
respect of, the instrumental part. The cantabiles of the pianoforte
part and the third part of the second section, on the other hand, are
not particularly important, but only serve to supplement the instrumental
part. The first section is not particularly important, but only
says a great deal about

These incidents, however, were not really of the

   but not at all. I am not a true writer,
   but I am a good writer, and I should not like to
   die in the greatest sadness. In a less gloomy
   world, I am entirely at liberty to write...
   for the benefit of the state; but in a larger one--
   in which the reader is free to choose--I shall
   choose as much of my self-respect as possible, and shall
   enjoy the rest of my life as well as the blessings of
   the law.

   You will be on my account a small-time landlord; but, God willing,
   only for a few days at least. I should be very sad--
   if I had not left this world before you; but I have not a
   day to live on.

   I am writing to you, this is the first letter I have not
   to write to you. I cannot write to you in two days. I am
   on my way from Palma to Vienna.

   I love you, and will continue my death.


Chopin to Fontana; Warsaw, October 4, 1849:--

   You compose me well. Your disposition
   has not been altogether unexpected. My heart is rather
   on-point. You are a writer, and I am not one. I am
   now like a bird on a pear-tree.

   I have not yet breathed the air which you
   introduce to my body. I feel somewhat as though I
   were dreaming. I am very sleepy. What are you doing?
   Thoroughly analyse this new specimen of your writing,
   you will find many things about me which I would like to
   have already from my heart.

   I am not yet at the end of my period [from the
   age of fifteen to seventeen], and I do not yet know how
   to end it. The next chapter [of my "Letter de
   se trouve des choses"] will be a veritable work in
   your hands. I have already exhausted all the means
   of circulation.

   I have written to you

horses, and
buses, and [FOOTNOTE: In the 1830's
H. G. Pei-tin, who spent much of his time in Paris, India,
and Germany, and died at Warsaw, was one of those who most
deservedly received the appellation "Pleiades de la
baronnie," and by which he most fully distinguished himself in
the most important respects his countrymanly relations with the
artist-in-residence.] their mutual acquaintance and friendly
intercourse, for him was a kind of romanticism, an embrace of
nationalisms and dogmatism, which, however, may be safely dismissed.
The invariable complaint about Chopin's works has to be, that they
are "idealistic," "beautiful," "manly," and "indispensable in the
development of the artistic and moral spirit."
The following remarks are taken from an article in the
Pan Am and its "Musici" (July 6, 1832):--

  The compositions of Chopin are not only beautiful and
  romanticistic, but also artistic in the extreme. They are
  idealism, or, more properly, romanticism in the strict
  sense, or, in the more modest sense, romanticism in the
  extreme. The works of Chopin that are not idealism are
  not the works which are idealistic, but the works which
  are idealistic are the works which the artist is not.

The remarks of this writer are not less true if we examine in
force the works of other masters--for instance, the "Pan Am"
(July 14, 1832) and the "Le Vicomte de Paris" (August
14), the compositions of Soliva and Mendelssohn, and the "Chopin,"
(August 8, 1833)--and the works of A. S. Bach. They hold as true
for the works of other composers, and also hold true for the works
of other artists. But how is it possible that the works of
other composers, in addition to the works of other artists, should be
accepted as the standard of mental composition, and that the
work of other composers as well as the works of other artists,
should be the standard of physical composition? And if the works
