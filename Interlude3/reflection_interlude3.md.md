-   What is the main message of this module?
-   How does it connect with your ideas for your Unessay?
-   What does it mean to ‘do history’ when the machine is a co-creator of the experience working on its own
    -   that is, you haven’t explicitly coded particular elements or experiences, they **emerge** on their own: what’s the role of the historian here?
-   How does this intersect with things you saw in module 1, module 2? BE EXPLICIT.
    -   revamp the HPS framework: what is the ‘problem space’ when you’re trying to simulate some phenomenon in the past?
    -   what is the ‘problem space’ when you are ‘raising the dead’, and creating some kind of simulacrum of a historical figure?
    -   how does this feed into my question about what it means to do history in such a world? You might want to reflect/draw connections, analogies with, this piece by [Alan Liu, “Theses on Large Language Models and ‘Good’ Writing”](https://liu.english.ucsb.edu/theses-on-large-language-models-and-good-writing/).

# Introduction 

For this final interlude, I decided to change things a little in favour of increased readability and coherance. For the past two interlude, I have been writing my thoughts down as it came to me and tried to loosely organize it in a more or less comprehensible fashion. This week, I will break my reflection in three parts, each referencing an in-class exercise and the readings. Each parts will reference one week of the module. I will begin by discussing the implications of [prodecural generation](https://hist3812.netlify.app/slides/nov14) in the *context of the GPT-2 exercise* we did and while considering [Aaron Reed](https://if50.substack.com/p/1971-the-oregon-trail?s=r) and [Josh Dzieza](https://www.theverge.com/c/23194235/ai-fiction-writing-amazon-kindle-sudowrite-jasper)'s contribution on the topic of **AI**. I will then follow with a reflection on our process of [sonification](https://hist3812.netlify.app/slides/nov21.html) and its implication in the context of the readings that week. Finally, I will wrap up with a critical exploration of *self-sustaining simulation and seeing how they can essential play themselves* while reflecting on [Professor Graham](https://www.sidestone.com/openaccess/9789088904363.pdf) and [T. CSzczepanska, A. Angourakis, S. Graham, and M. Borit](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-92843-8_15)'s exploration of agent based models and social simulations.
