[Jeremiah McCall](https://gamingthepast.net/) has developed a framework for analyzing historical games called the 'Historical Problem Space Framework.' An article discussing his ideas in some depth is available [here](https://jgeekstudies.org/2019/04/22/playing-with-the-past-history-and-video-games-and-why-it-might-matter/)

‘Playing with the Past: History and Video Games (and Why It Might Matter)’. _Journal of Geek Studies_, 23 Apr. 2019, https://jgeekstudies.org/2019/04/22/playing-with-the-past-history-and-video-games-and-why-it-might-matter/.

Use the HPSF as a kind of check on your design: what kind of historical experience have you designed? What historical perspectives have you built into your experience? What historical thinking are you asking your player to perform?

# What is the HPS framework?

[Salma]
The Historical Problem Space (HPS) Framework is a game design concept developed by Jeremiah McCall. It is a method of understanding and analyzing the design of video games, particularly those based on historical events or eras. The HPS Framework examines the way that video games are designed to simulate or represent past events/settings, and how these representations can be used to create meaningful and engaging gameplay experiences. It looks at the ways in which the game’s design elements, such as tools and obstacles, are used to create a believable, engaging, and meaningful historical experience. It encourages game developers to think critically about the ways in which they represent history, and helps them to create games that are both historically accurate and enjoyable to play.

## Genre
- Simulation - Recreation of real life buildings in virtual space
- Sandbox
[Max]
## Gameworld
- Historical buildings in a virtual sandbox space: explorable, explicit space
[Salma]
## Player Agent
- The audience (Porfessor Shawn)
- Some player ability restricted (players always in adventure mode so they can't destroy the blocks or build)
- Sandbox - player can roam around
[Max]
## Agents
- Not applicable. There are no NPCs or characters that advance the story. The player advances is own story.
[Salma]
## Resources
- The game can provide players with historical facts and context to help them understand the history of the architecture. By doing this, players can gain a better understanding of the architecture's past and the similarities it shares with other architectures. The information is located in hidden books within the architectural spaces.
[Max]
## Tools
- Your right hand can click buttons to trigger events such as teleport, and open chests to find books
[Salma]
- Command block: player can teleport to any architecture buildings by going to the “hub” just follow the “beacon” (laser/light shooting through the sky) and select the architectural space to teleport to.
[Max]
## Obstacles
- The hidden nature of the books forces and encourages the player to explore the entire building and immerse itself to learn.
[Max]
## Game Goals
1. Learn information about the historical building
	1. Find hidden books throughout the buildings' explicit space
	2. Connect the information of these books for the relevant building
	3. Connect the historical context of the buildings with Canadian History
	4. Gain understanding of global impliction of Canada in world history
[Max]
## Choices / Actions
- Choosing what buildings to look at first, in which order, and how long/deeply to look at them.
[Salma]
- Teleport
- Observe the architecture
- Read the books
