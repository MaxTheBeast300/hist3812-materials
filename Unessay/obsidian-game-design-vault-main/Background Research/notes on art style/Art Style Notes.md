Drop screenshots or other artwork into this folder. 

Then, if you want to make a note on them, either embed them in a note via markdown:
`![description](filename.jpg)` 

Or you can arranged multiple images by listing them in sequence (courtesy of the settings for the minimal theme we're using). Add an empty row between lists of images to create a new row in the grid.

Note that 'live preview' affects this; you must turn live preview off in the editor settings, then click on the 'preview' button.
