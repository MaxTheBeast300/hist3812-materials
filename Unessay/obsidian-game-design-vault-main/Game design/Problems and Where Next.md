### Problems with Developments

[Ky]
One of our major issues with development was time; simply put, we didn’t have enough time to build everything we were planning to build. We had plans to build other historic and culturally significant buildings; the CN Tower, the Eiffel Tower, a Saturn V rocket, and the International Space Station were all considered in our plans.

Minor complication:
-   The command block broke but then it got fixed
-   Animals keep getting into the Notre-Dame cathedral

Technical problems:
-   Not everyone is proficient with minecraft, so building and editing the world was mostly done by Ky and Max since they were the most knowledgeable with the intricacies of Minecraft.
-   Minecraft offers basically unlimited features that could enhance our unessay, but effectively using them requires deep understanding of how the game works which is something all of us would have had to research and extensively learn. Because of a lack of time, this extra step was not realistic.

### More changes to the game not yet implemented

[Max]
Due to a lack of time, and technical resources, the prototype for the unessay concept was very limited and does not fully reflect what the final product may have looked like with the adequate technical skills. Here are a few features that would have been improved with more time and research:

-   The location where books are placed directly reflects the information written in it. For example, if a book is placed next to a Catholic altar, it will talk about how Christianity intersects with Canadian identity and its connection to Europe. Also, there would have been more books spread around the buildings in all buildings. For now, as a proof of concept, only Notre Dame and Saint Basils have books.
-   At the moment, the buildings used in the concept build are roughly placed in the world. They are not yet clearly delimited, and show many artifacts of world edit. World edit is a plugin we used directly in the game to move large amounts of blocks and buildings without having to build everything again by hand. When copying a building, it can only copy it in a cube shape. Therefore, when pasted, it cuts directly into the land and creates these obvious scars of displacement. With more time, buildings would have been implemented into the land much more seamlessly and in an appropriate environment.
-   Adding NPCs or “quest givers” would have helped guide players who may feel a bit more lost in the sandbox world. But instead of commanding what the player should do, they would only give hints and proposed ways of approaching the museum. At the end of the day, the decision rests on the player to decide how they want to experience the museum.
-   Sound is also another element that was beyond our expertise as it requires direct modification of minecraft game files (adding sound files in the game). It would have helped immerse the player in the building. For example, the Saint Basils could have religious Russian music echoing in the halls, reflecting its religious significance. Or, if we want to go more dramatic, the Heron bridge could trigger an event where it breaks and a sound of crumbling is played. Sound has a lot of ways that it could have made buildings feel more alive then just empty shells.
-   Using the map feature of Minecraft and combining it with a mod, it could be possible to add a progress map. This progress map would show the world with numerous red dots spread throughout it. These dots represent a building and where it is located. When a building is visited, that dot turns green. And when a connection is found between two buildings, a white link is drawn between the two green dots. The goal at the end would be to end up with a map filled with intersected links all culminating to Canada showing its connection with the outside world.
