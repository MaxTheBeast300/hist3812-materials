Since we used a developed game as the host for our virtual museum, the features we used were already implemented features, developed and tested, by the Mojang team at Microsoft. However, we deem it adequate to provide a list of in-game features we used to create the world and its buildings.

## Feature 1: Command Blocks

Command Blocks are blocks in Minecraft only available to players with special permissions in a given world, and only via a specific in-game command. They act as a command terminal for the game (much like windows command terminal). As such, they can be used to write command lines such as teleportation that can be used by the player without the player being able to alter the code. They are used to transport the player through the world.

## Feature 2: Buttons

Minecraft uses what is called “buttons”, a block that can be placed anywhere. However, depending on which block it is placed, it can trigger an event through “redstone”, Minecraft’s version of electricity. Buttons allow players to interact with the command blocks to teleport to the selected buildings. They can be interacted with the right hand (right mouse click). They are meant to be used by the player and as a resource. 

## Feature 3: Minecraft Beacons

A Minecraft beacon is a block that can be placed on a small pyramid of 9 blocks (or more) that emits a never-ending light in the sky. They have many purposes depending on the world, but for the purposes of this world, they are used as a landmark for guiding players towards certain regions and checkpoints in case they are lost. They are built near teleportation checkpoints for players to go back to the central hub.

## Feature 4: Building and destroying

Although evident, Minecraft’s ability of placing blocks and destroying blocks in a sandbox world is what ultimately allows us to build huge and complex structures. However, this feature is removed from the player in hope of promoting building preservations. If the player had the permission to build and destroy as they wish, this would imply a different goal for the unessay.
