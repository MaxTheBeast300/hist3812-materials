**The world is untouched by the player**

The player cannot touch or alter the world. They can only interact with it in limited ways, and observe from a removed position.

**The buildings teaches the player**

The buildings do not force upon the player a forced narrative, it should instead encourage the player to find perspectives on the buildings and their connection with other buildings.

[Max]
**Buildings connect

The buildings connect in multiple ways such as architecturally, culturally, socially, historically, and politically.
