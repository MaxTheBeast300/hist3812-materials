# Narrative summary

[Shafik]
The player, who plays as themselves, is transposed into a virtual world. The world is full of buildings from different parts of the world, and the player has to visit each one of them and find books of information to learn more about them and their connection to the other buildings. The player can visit any building in any order, but will ultimately come to their own conclusion on the connection depending on how many information books they found. The levels are non-linear, but the culmination of experience should narrow down to a similar conclusion about Canadaâ€™s implication in world history through an exploration of various, seemingly unrelated buildings.

## Nature of the narrative

The player does not need to abide by a strict linear narrative. If it so chooses, it can explore the buildings in the chronological appearance of signs, or it can choose whatever building and start from there, and choose a different after. This puts less emphasis on the museum's would-be pushed narratives, and more on the player's ability to put together context and clues.
