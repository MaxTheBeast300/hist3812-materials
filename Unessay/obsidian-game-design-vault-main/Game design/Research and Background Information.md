### St Basil Cathedral In Moscow:

The Saint Basil Cathedral is a church located near the Red Square in Moscow. The cathedral was constructed between 1554 and 1560 under orders by the late Tsar Ivan IV famously known as Ivan the Terrible. The Cathedral was used as a symbolic symbol from a military victory over the khanates of both Kazan and Astrakhan. The church is dedicated to the protection and intercession of The Virgin (J.E. Luebring, 1). It was known as the Cathedral of Vasily Blazhenny (St. Basil the Beatified) after a Holy Russian who buried himself in the church’s vaults during the reign of Tsar Fyodor I (1584-98).

The church was designed by two Russian Architects, Posnik and Barma. It was also said in a popular legend it was built by an Italian architect who was blinded, causing him to be unable to replicate a church that is equivalent or similar to the St Basil cathedral (J.E. Luebring, 1).

The cathedral features a symmetrical design, with two towers (69 m) flanking a central nave, and a façade featuring three large portals and two rose stained glass windows. The interior is divided into three levels, the ground level, the triforium, and the clerestory. The ground level contains the main halls of the cathedral, including the choir and the nave. The triforium is a gallery which is located between the ground level and the clerestory. The clerestory is the highest level, which contains the stained glass windows. The roof of the cathedral is composed of a series of steeply sloped arches, creating a distinctive silhouette.

### The Ottawa Parliament Building:

The Parliament Hill building in Ottawa is the seat of the Government of Canada and one of the country's most iconic landmarks. Located in the city's downtown core, the building has been the home of Canada's parliament since 1867 when the British North America Act was passed, unifying the colonies of Canada, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick into the nation of Canada. The building itself is designed in the Gothic Revival style, which was popular in the 19th century. It was designed by the architect Thomas Fuller, who also designed the nearby Confederation Building. The Parliament Hill building consists of three main structures: Centre Block, East Block and West Block. The Centre Block, which is the largest of the three structures, contains the Senate and House of Commons chambers, as well as the Library of Parliament. The East Block and West Block, which flank the Centre Block, are used for offices and committee rooms. The Peace Tower, a prominent feature of the building, is located on the Centre Block and stands over 92 metres high. It was built to commemorate the end of the First World War and includes a carillon of 53 bells. The Parliament Hill building is open to the public and guided tours are available. It is also the site of many special events and gatherings throughout the year.

## How they all connect

### Saint Basil’s Cathedral links to Ottawa history by way of NATO, and the Gouzenko Affair

#### What is NATO?

Following the end of World War Two in Europe, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France were worried that the growing influence of the Soviet Union, and Stalin’s version of communism were a potential threat to the hard-won end of hostilities. The western powers were exhausted, having used up a lot of their military strength defending, repelling, and then defeating Nazi Germany on the western front; the European west was spent, and with the continuing Pacific Theatre, the United States and Canada were stretched thin as well. By contrast, the USSR had emerged as a burgeoning superpower, and Stalin had consolidated his power, fully taking over countries the Red Army had liberated from German occupation. The western powers feared that Stalin would try to expand his influence further and attempt to fully control Europe in the other nations’ weakened state.

Those fears soon proved to be true when, on 5 September 1945, a Soviet defector named Igor Gouzenko revealed to the world that Russian espionage networks operated everywhere, eventually leading to the arrest of 26 Soviet agents and signifying the start of the cold war. In 1948 a Soviet-backed communist uprising in Czechoslovakia took over their government, and the Soviets tried to blockade West Berlin from receiving supplies, thwarted by what became known as the “Berlin Airlift.” While tensions were rising between the USSR and the West, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada had already been in secret talks to establish an alliance as a protection measure against the Soviets, and were soon joined by France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and Norway. Eventually the founding twelve nations formed NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, an alliance between Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

NATO was formed to act as an anti-war deterrent, rather than a show of force. While it’s called an alliance, it is closer in design to a defensive pact, detailed in Article 5 which essentially declares that an attack on one member of the alliance is an attack on all of them. The logic being that Russia would have to declare war on all twelve nations in order to advance their influence on one of them using force. Article 5 has only ever been invoked once, by the United States following the September 11 attacks in 2001. Today there are 30 members of the alliance, in addition the original 12, they have been joined by Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czechia, Estonia, Germany (who joined before reunification as West Germany), Greece, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, and Turkey; with Ukraine, Georgia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Sweden, and Finland officially aspiring to join in 2022.

#### How does this link to Saint Basil’s Cathedral?

Собо́р Васи́лия Блаже́нного, or the Cathedral of Vasily the Blessed (officially “Cathedral of the Intercession of the Most Holy Theotokos on the Moat,” “Vasily” is the Russian form of “Basil”) is in the Red Square in Moscow, where Московский Кремль, or “Moscow Kremlin” is also located, and has been the seat of Russia’s government since the Soviet Revolution in 1918. The cathedral is one of the most recognizable landmarks in Moscow and has even at times been confused as the actual seat of government; the Cathedral is thus an unofficial symbol of the Russian (and Soviet by proxy) government. The Gouzenko Affair occurred in Ottawa, specifically in Gouzenko’s residence at the time (511 Somerset Street), which is the link between Ottawa and the Soviet government; and Ottawa, being the capital of Canada, is also linked to NATO as Canada was one of the founding members of the alliance.

### Notre Dame de Paris’ linked to the Ottawa Parliament Building

The most evident link between the Notre Dame de Paris and the Ottawa Parliament Building is the similar architectural style in which they are built. The Notre Dame de Paris is built in the French gothic style, which is what inspired the British neo-gothic in the 19th century. This display is meant to make the player see the connection between the styles and see how European notions were forced onto the Indigenous land. The Ottawa Parliament building is built in the British Neo-Gothic style, which reflects the imperialistic views of the Europeans when they came to settle and force away the rights of the indigenous people on the land. Seeing these connections, the player should become aware of the Canadian reality of the land and its connection to European buildings.
